 1. Clarify the Intention of what you want to create. If it isn't written down it isn't real. 
 2. Create a Brand and Identity.
 3. Get an email address.
 4. Create Group Chat for your supporters.
 5. Create your Content. 
 6. Register for Filesharing Account.
 7. Create Website.
 8. Create Reddit / Fetlife or other social media account to popularise.

#### Keys to Success

Focus on Intention and answer the Content Creation Questions:

- What is it intended to do?
- Who is it for?
- How will I know when it’s done?

Avoid Drama. Do not make a publicly accessible Discord server. Do not allow known Hypnokink Troublemakers (See List) to access your content.

Be true to yourself and your inner voice when it comes to who you are and what unique contributions you have to make to the world :-) Do not allow anyone else to make the decisions or do the thinking for you. Seek help and advice from people BEFORE you need it, but remember that you are under no obligation to follow it. 

#### Audio Recording - Software and Hardware including Example Setups

**Intention**

Create an extremely simple list covering the hardware and software useful to create your own recordings. Voice techniques and recording content are covered separately.

**Quickstart**

**Software**

Use Ocenaudio for recording and editing audio. Hook it up with Waves Clarity Vx for background Noise Cancellation.

**Hardware**

The best microphone is the one that you have on you. Using your phone is completely fine. An excellent midrange microphone is AudioTechnica AT2020USB+ or Blue Microphones Yeti. For a Recording setup you will need a Microphone, a Pop Filter and a Microphone Stand (to hold the Microphone).

#### My Exact Setup

Summary - Record on iPhone using Voice Memos built-in app. Upload to computer using Filen. Edit in Ocenaudio. Move to another Filen folder for distribution.

For spontaneous, non-scripted audios I use my iPhone with the Voice Memos app and an uncompressed file format - you can change this in the settings, then compress down for publication once on your computer.

For scripted audios I use a AudioTechnica AT2020USB+ with this stand and popfilter. Editing in Ocenaudio, importing into Audacity only if I want to add background music, then export to a Filen folder for distribution.

**Eliminating Background Noise FROM recordings**

Buy a license to Waves Clarity Vx Plugin. Note that Pro version is not needed, just the basic version.

Open Ocenaudio, add plugin and add the folder location below. It will pick up Waveshell, in Mono and Stereo versions.

Windows:
64 - bit — **C:\Program Files\VSTPlugins**
32 - bit — **C:\Program Files (x86)\VSTPlugins**
Mac: **Macintosh HD > Library > Audio > Plugins > VST**

Make recordings.
Run Plugin and tweak to reduce noise.
Publish

**Eliminating Background Noise WHILE recording**

A little trickier but basically the same.

Download and install Waves Clarity Vx, run it through LightHost, then use Voicemeeter to connect all your virtual inputs together so your recording / streaming software can connect to it and record. Buy a license to Waves Clarity Vx Plugin. Note that Pro version is not needed, just the basic version.

Download and run LightHost
Run the right version 32 or 64 bit and RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR

Add the location Folder and Scan to show up plugins
Turn the plugin on

During installation, the WaveShell-VST is placed in these default locations:

Windows:
64 - bit — **C:\Program Files\VSTPlugins**
32 - bit — **C:\Program Files (x86)\VSTPlugins**
Mac: **Macintosh HD > Library > Audio > Plugins > VST**

Install Voicemeeter and connect up inputs
