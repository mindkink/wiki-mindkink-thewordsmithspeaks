*Has been a victim of a well known asshole organising his fans to attack her after she stood up for one of the victims of his terrible behaviour (see the List of HypnoKink Troublemakers, elsewhere).*

*Has used her platform to advocate for subject agency against several highly placed and verified abusive individuals at tremendous personal risk to herself. Profoundly ethical and gentle human being who displays a high degree of care for people in general. If you're a content creator of any kind copy the way she does her content warnings and descriptions on YouTube videos and audio production, her content descriptions are essentially the gold standard.*
