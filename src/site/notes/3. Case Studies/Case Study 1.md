### Introduction

The following writing is a recent review from a Client. With their encouragement I have published it here.

**Please note** - this is all a single review and is written entirely by the Client. Any medical diagnoses were done by previous medical practitioners and not by myself.

## Context

Over the last few months several clients have recommended me to others, and purely through these recommendations I have seen almost two dozen cases in only a few months of Clients dealing with Gender Dysphoria, primarily Transgender and Non-Binary Identifying. 

With Clients now relieved of Anxiety, Body Dysmorphia, and Trauma as well as any other related presenting issues and with the Clients universally happy with the outcome, the majority now identify as Bisexual, with several identifying as Genderfluid or Femboys / Tomboys, and with two returning to identifying as Crossdressers.

I have developed several evidence supported and effective treatment protocols for the resolution of Gender Dysphoria to the positive satisfaction of the victim of the condition, and will be publishing these protocols so other professionals can improve them.

Please note that I am aware that the formatting / presentation of this document is not perfect - It's my first Case Study and I didn't have any help. If you'd like to assist with formatting, suggest resources or advice, please email me at thewordsmithspeaks@pm.me

### Client Overview

**Client has a past history of Eating Disorder**

- If anything my most self destructive behaviour was the binge eating after starving myself for days. My cycle was I wouldn't eat ANYTHING for one day. This continued until the end of the following day which would descend into a binge, and the cycle would repeat itself. This was combined with me running literally 8 miles every day. It consumed my life.

**Trauma from Male Parent**

- This is actually so much to unpack. My Father was never physically abusive towards me but he had an immense amount of anxiety that he spread to everyone in his proximity. He was indirectly emotionally abusive in this way and had ton of OCD behaviours from the anxiety.

The abridged version to provide you a a snapshot:

- As children, my sister and I were literally drilled for when a burglar would break into our house. This involved a siren going off at random times.

- When I was a teenager he pulled his gun out at me once because he wasn't expecting anyone to be home and thought I was a stranger that broke in.

- When my Father was giving me the birds-and-the-bees talk he got frustrated when I started crying. (Mind you I was 12.) His reaction to my tears was to whip his dick out and start yelling at me about how it is normal. I've honestly blocked out most of it, but I've never forgot the distress from that moment.

- This tangentially relates to the gender because as a child I remember wanting to be NOTHING like him. I had no positive male role model in my life. If anything my Mother was the supportive loving figure in my life and I modelled myself after her.
  
**Diagnoses - Pre-existing prior to treatment**

Gender Dysphoria (F64.0)

- The process for getting medication was far easier than I expected. My first Doctor's appointment I literally had to go to one therapy appointment, and then was approved. My rationale at that time was "I'm just going to try this and if I don't like it then I don't have to continue". Other factors that pushed me were a rising awareness this was an option through seeing individuals in my social media feed who transitioned. There was a lot of social pressure.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (F90.9)

- Diagnosed as a child with and has been medicated more or less consistently since.

Anorexia nervosa, Binge Eating / Purging type (F50.02)

- It developed when I was in my undergraduate at college, but I had body dysmorphia issues since I was a teenager. I would always shower in the dark and never look at my body in the mirror. Like I wouldn't even look at my genitals.

**List all the medication names you were taking:**

- Adderall XR 15mg QD
- Straterra 40mg QD
- Estradiol Valerate (100mg/5mL) 0.2 mL Q3D
- Progesterone 100mg QD

## Before (Prior to Sessions):  

### Identity:

- I identified / believed I was a Transwoman.
- Asexual

### Beliefs:

**Internalised Learned Helplessness**

- I was convinced *on some level* that I could not get better.

- I had spent an unbelievable amount of time watching myself repeat certain self-destructive behaviours. It seemed like no matter HOW HARD I tried I would always relapse in some way. As a consequence, I always had an impending sense of despair that the cycle would repeat itself.

**Constant Self Doubt**

- I was *ALWAYS* doubtful.

- I could never make any decision in life out of fear whether it was the *right* choice. Nothing would ever get done as a result. It was so hard to make effective traction in life.

**Persistent and debilitating Anxiety** 

- It was woven into every aspect of my life, and couldn't see how it much it detracting until it was stripped away from me.  

**Chronic Intermittent Dissociation**

- I struggled infinitely with being present.  This was sometimes the most distressing experience to me because it was the state of consciousness I was most acutely aware of when I would phase into it, and felt like I had absolutely NO control of it. It felt so deeply wrong to be in. I could know something was wrong but felt helpless to get out of it - I'm tearing up even thinking back on it. It's inconceivable to me that I haven't felt that way sense. It feels like this incredibly blessing given to me.

**Fear of Responsibilities & Taking Accountability**

- This fuelled the anxiety because I was not empowering myself by taking action.

- Jobless / I could not maintain a job for any prolonged length of time.

**Inability to express myself**

- This was actually insane to me how debilitating this was. It was only through working with Daniel that it became apparent how much of an issue it was. I am so so relieved it is not a problem anymore.

**People pleasing and over apologetic.**

**Relationship Struggles**: so many

## After (Post Sessions):

### Identity

- Happy. *Literally* everyday feels like a gift.

- Even when there's challenges, there's a beauty to life that can't be undone. I don't know if the gravity of that adequate comes through to anyone reading this right now, but this is so *fundamentally* true to me now.

- Oh - I love myself too now. Who I am as a person and how I look.

- It's become so normalized now that I forget it sometimes. I am so proud of the person I've become and can see all my good qualities now.
- The byproduct of loving yourself is that you take vastly better care of yourself. Underrated af.

- I came to terms with being Genderfluid. A MASSIVELY better change.  

- Accepting both aspects of who I am relieves so much tension. Instead trying to conform to a preconceived expectation something you *think* you need to be.  

- Bisexual. I had my sexual awakening. Still unbelievable I can feel this good now. It's literally amazing and Daniel can do it.  

- I am VASTLY more relaxed and calm. Level-headed generally. An INCREDIBLE change.

- Observable by numerous people in my life without any prompting on my part from them. It has allowed me to make connections more easily with others and literally improved EVERY aspect of my life. My energy sets the precedent for others.  

- One of the most measurable / observable behaviours I can observe with this is... that I use to *always* be clenching my X. More so when I was stressed. It would happen automatically without me realizing it.  Ever since working with Daniel I don't think I have observed any instances yet, but I think it was a physical demonstration and manifestation of the worry I had in me.

- I am so more confident.

- I can actually make decisions now. I can learn from experiences more effectively because there's no shame in making a mistake. I just learn from it and move forward with stride.

### Behaviours

- I actually use my words now and articulate myself better.

- I always liked vocabulary but would filter myself significantly because I was afraid of alienating people by being too different. Now I just embrace my uniqueness and people seem to really appreciate that confidence in who you are. Plus, it's really fun using different words.

- More proactive at work and in my relationship.

- Fear no longer motivates me, it's love for my self and the pride I can derive my living a life I am personally proud of and hopefully inspire others in.

### Life

- I literally am in the best job I have ever had.

- Not only is it the role I've always wanted but the compensation is better than I've ever had before. The work-life balance has also been lovely.

- My relationship with my boyfriend has gotten so much better.

- There's a sigh of relief as I say that. I worried for so long whether we could connect more deeply. There was a wall for a long time (that I had unknowingly been imposing).  Daniel taught me how to understand my boyfriend's needs more and how I can better accommodate and communicate.  He taught me how to surrender fully, and that has made the sex amazing in a way I never could have dreamed of. I can enthusiastically give myself entirely and that's sometimes one of the BEST feelings in the world to me.  

- I have so much vigour and passion for life now.

- My latest and longest lasting interest has been understanding hypnotherapy and these different mechanisms that underlie everyone's life. I think ... when something touches your life so profoundly, it has the natural effect. Every day I am literally reading or trying to learn and connect these concepts. It's my hope to continue learning as much as I can from Daniel because I really believe he has connected dots that are unbeknownst to a large majority of the world. Dots that can be life-changing.

## Post Session Observations by Client at the 3 Month Point

Thank fuck someone like you exists and has developed themselves to this calibre where they are able to make such an impact in people's lives. 

It is not an exaggeration to say you changed the ENTIRE trajectory of my life in a way objectively for the better by every measure.

---

It feels like my life started when I began hypnotherapy. That's not a figure of speech. There's a continuity (in my self / life) that began with our work.

There's this sense of wholeness he created when he healed me or helped me heal (whatever way you want to think of it). 

---

Extras (potentially insert above):

My speculation for this feeling of continuity & beginning is *before* I was so fractured in my personality. I was in a state of dysfunction. Living moment-to-moment.

I think the effect of this feeling is I had no *sense* of moving in any direction, and since resolving it I feel like I'm actually MOVING in a continually positive direction each day. I'm building towards something I can see and perceive now. It's woven up in my own desires, but also my Partners desires - and I'm perfectly okay with that. I'm happy to be contributing and be of service, and striving to become an exceptional person, as Daniel naturally seems to inspire just by being himself. 

He helped give me a sense of meaning and drive that I didn't fully have before. I'm fascinated with this world he's opened me up to, and I just want to understand it as deeply and intimately as possible - because there's SO MUCH utility to this. It was literally life-changing for me in terms of my trajectory and overall success in life. So many people I observe sometimes are stuck in this cycle or trench. They desperately want to get out. Escape themselves and become happier but can't seem to do it effectively on their own.

Daniel knows how to effectively "unlock" you and enable you to live a more fulfilling, joyful, and successful life. Literally so much more than that - but in broad terms this is what he enacts.

Continued...

It's now my belief and real perceived reality that we are comprised of different "aspects" of ourselves. I know that might be met with scepticism to some, but I swear if you pay attention to your inner dialogue for long enough you will start to notice distinctions AND trends in the different "voices". 

Each serves their own unique purpose. They develop as we go through life, but the role they adopt might not always be what they're best suited for. 

We phase into these different states of consciousness so rapidly and so seamlessly that it's hard to recognize it - especially if you aren't attuned to it yet.

Working with Daniel not only allowed me to see my different ego states at work, but also allowed them to work in a more harmonious way. A committee of sorts!

---

It's SO fascinating how clearly you can see the world when your lens isn't tinted with shame, guilt, or worry. 

Your whole mental landscape is clear to perceive both what's inside you, and others. 

Getting lifted out of the trauma into this state of perception is simply... surreal.

It has this effect where you can look in on others and see the noise in them.

It was always there and maybe you picked up on it before - but it will seem so much more apparent and clear in a way I don't even have the words to adequately convey the experience of.

---

I had a potentially good quote but it just stemmed from an observation I just had.

I can logically look in on my feelings towards my partner and be stunned at an influence of that magnitude that can be instilled into someone.

I am grateful for the awareness you have regarding the responsibility that comes from owning someone and the guidance you have been offering me whether directly or indirectly demonstrating a better life is possible.

## Intrasession Reviews

All content is shared at the explicit request of the Client. These are the post-session reflections from the Client and as discussed above, shared with their explicit and written encouragement and informed consent.

### Post Session 1

**No anxiety???**

- It feels as if you erased my anxiety, which I just DO NOT comprehend how that could be possible, after struggling with it for my entire life. I'll observe blips of anxiety surface but they almost automatically dissipate.  

- In the extreme cases of potency, sometimes it is just "an anxious thought" surfacing but I do not feel it. There is a distinction I am observing.

**Reduction in shame**

- Less a need to people-please.

- Advocating for my own needs without shame. 

**More Decisive / Confident**

- My unconscious is just acting on its own - and it's freeing my mind up to focus on more important things. Instead of letting indecision get in the way of step in my life.

- Tangible outside evidence: My boyfriend commented that I was sounding really confident and professional during a phone call I took. This was prior to me telling him anything about our session or the changes that I was feeling. So this felt like an objective unit of measurement.

- I can just ACT now instead of hesitating, as soon as my unconscious signals.

**Synchronicity with unconscious** 

- I feel like I am operating more upon my unconscious guidance rather than always being in conflict with what it's telling me to do.

- I can perceive my "unconscious hand" more now and as a consequence can lean into it. I believe you have made my a better Subject because now I have this tool I can access better. (I think there's lots of room for improvement though 🙂)

- It feels like I am acting more naturally now? _It feels as if my unconscious is just automatically regulating things for me in a more conducive way._

**Increased sexual responsiveness** 

- I notice that whatever you implanted for intimacy, surfaces when I am at the brinks of unconsciousness / just about to fall asleep - It feels like this SURGE of arousal / desire coursing through me when it happens. That's so stunning to me. Can you clarify what's happening there?

- I feel like I somehow have less control now. I feel like I am controlled by my body / sexual desires now and I am happy about it? It's just shocking to feel so different. It's not as if I didn't want that before - but I just didn't know how good it would feel. 

- You facilitating me finally feeling safe has allowed for me to be more connected to my body and actually respond to arousal. I noticed when my boyfriend would initiate, it was such a strong automatic response in me.

**Present in the moment** 

- It literally feels like I am generally more present. Sometimes it feels like I am FULLY present. I can't remember the last time I have ever felt that way.

**JOURNALED QUOTES**

Some of this is kind of embarrassing haha but I am sharing because I think it captures the efficacy of what you did in a really candid way.

> 
> why wouldn't this be more mainstream?

**CLARIFYING MOMENTS IN SESSION**

- Initially, I was struggling to go into trance, which is why I suddenly shifted my description for the internal location I was perceiving. I was thinking too cerebrally rather than what I was FEELING. I knew I was there when I tapped into, where do I feel safe / comfortable right now? Then it suddenly dawned on me where I was. 

    > It was a beach at twilight. The sky was this purple hue and the waves a deep indigo.  
    > The sand wasn't sand. It was like this iridescent opal pearls(?) It's really beyond describing.  
    > I was curled up in the "sand" and just was feeling at peace.  
    > I was alone. I am confident in that. I think I could feel, hear, and smell there.

- The specific moment I went back to in childhood was the first time I remember feeling wrong for my preference towards femininity.   
    > It was in my parent's bedroom in the bath area in the morning. I had a childhood friend over and I was excited to show him the new album from The Cheetah Girls. I don't recall what he said to me right now but I remember feeling shamed for something, that previously I had never felt shame over. I didn't stand up for myself in that moment.

**DREAMS**

> This dream has happened twice now. I only know that because of the feeling of familiarity when I am there.
> I was at an Airbnb that I don't recall ever being at before.
> It was nighttime and I was at a **social gathering / party with peers**.
> I'm either a teenage or young adult.
> There was a girl and **someone** else who **didn't like me**. Vague feeling these were people I knew in the past.
> I was **feeling insecure** / less than. **I wanted to get out of there**.
> There was an **elementary school** directly across from the Airbnb, where we were at. It was "haunted".
> **Every night it catches on fire** without explanation.
> We were watching it as it unfolded
> I rush inside to warn people.
> I don't recall how the dream ends but no one was hurt.

> boyfriend is railing me in walk-in bath area of my parent's bedroom  
> slow strokes but i am relishing it

> someone else was around and that was making it hotter for me. the casualness of being observed like that  
> definitely not either of my parents. because i have this feeling i like this person.  
> a masculine presence?  
> they gently move hair out of face and tuck strand behind ear.

> I am secure in myself now and that is so utterly surreal to finally feel that

> I am literally so happy to finally be hypnotized. Like it's such a genuine feeling of happiness that bubbles up upon that recognition. It didn't feel possible before but once it happened you are almost in this state of wonder

### Post Session 2

**Things I noticed (immediately after session):**
- Remarkable clarity in what decisions to make. The ​_*right*_ choice comes automatically.

- _Completely_ relaxed afterwards, in a way, that is extremely refreshing.

- Drastically less inhibitions. I am acting without thinking---and that's not a conscious decision but something I keep finding myself trending towards passively, which is surprising. It's just incredibly nice being this present.

- Feeling every experience ×100. There's more of a vibrance to every little mundane thing in life that you might not typically notice.

- The best gift you have helped give me is being more fully connected to my body. I am NEVER this present usually. For context, I have dealt with chronic intermittent dissociation for a long time. So it is AMAZING to feel it gone like this. It's like finally feeling alive.

**How the session made me feel:**

Initially, thrilled but was feeling some confliction the following day.

I was expecting the same degree of change as first session, so the discrepancy made me feel disappointed (not necessarily at either of us, just at the result).

I am attributing that to...

- Perceiving I need a longer induction, as trance is a skill I am learning still. 

I want to build confidence in my ability to drop reliably and deeply.

**What was the single most impactful moment from todays session?**  

I believe taking the first step to processing the sexual shame was REALLY important and understanding that I want to practice trance more and become 'perfect' at it.

**Clarifying moments from the session:**

- I struggled to actually visualize where sexual shame came from. I don't have a specific incident I could pull from. I felt something in the background occurring and did notice a reduction in shame.

**Ideas to maybe incorporate in future:**

- I think having restraints for session could be a fun way to help facilitate potency. My thinking being that, I am telling my body I have to accept this and 'let go'.  

- If there is a way I can comfortably see myself in mirror. Helps connect me to body and actually observe changes can intensifies feelings.

### Post Session 3

**Please describe everything that you remember from the session:**

- I remember you had me asking me two questions. I only remember the latter question about sexual reassignment surgery.  

- I remember anchoring different sensations with colors / symbols.  

- I remember "parts conflict" with hands. 

- Notes: During this I got too impatient or was putting too much pressure on myself. I think I need to give myself more permission to really allow things to naturally unfold. It was happening but I felt myself start to panic. I think we concluded the session shortly after. I remember being upset with myself but it spurred me to figure out how to resolve this. I now understand that it's a natural part of growth, and not a setback.

- I remember you talking about creating a new more feminine identity. Specifically, referring to my unconscious as "she/her", which made me excited at the prospect of! 😊

- Notes: It also explains why I have defaulted to referring to my as unconscious as "it/its" for a long time. Even though, I'd rather use "she/her" - it doesn't *always* feel natural if I am being honest. Comparatively, "he/him" is uncomfortable but feels slightly more natural.

**Things / Feelings I noticed during the session:**

In very beginning of session I felt myself passively dropping to your voice. Even thinking back to that realization, elicits a pleasurable feeling to to be under someone's control like that. I was trying to "resist" to be able to hold a conversation still.

- _Acceptance_  
    Symbol: Daisy | Color: White 🤍  

Notes: I feel confident about this one. It feels right on a deep level both consciously and unconsciously. I want to reinforce that synapse.

- _Obedience_  
    Symbol: (?) | Color: Red ❤  

Notes: I felt this spread throughout my body exactly as you described. It feels like it has melded together with pleasure - the action of submitting completely feels amazing. This feeling is persistent since the session, whenever I focus on it. Which is thrilling to be able to consistently elicit 🙂 It makes me feel more confident in my ability to respond to trance.  

At first I was skeptical whether this actually was the color. But! It dawned on me today that I think my brain was associating the color red with 'Control' because I've been watching X with my boyfriend recently. In it, X mind control is depicted as this red aura on X.

- _Arousal_  
    Symbol: (?) | Color: Dark Pink 🩷  

- Notes: I ​can't remember exactly what dark pink was suppose to represent. I don't recall if it was suppose to be arousal or pleasure.  
    I don't know if I feel confident in the color I chose. I said dark pink but I think what I was visualizing was "hot pink".

- _Fear  
    _Symbol: Scimitar | Color: Black 🖤

Notes: I don't know if I resonate with the symbol. Scimitar felt like it was more the conscious answer surfacing but I could be wrong. We were playing X earlier that evening and that was one of the weapons in it. So that's where that came from, is my perception.

**How the session made me feel:**

- I want to say deeply curious about the colour experience and these brand new sensations that were surfacing in me.  

- Initially, I was really out of sorts that night and following day.  

I have been feeling significantly better since and *extremely* motivated on hypnotherapy and other life endeavours right now. 💛

**What was the single most impactful moment from todays session?**

- Feeling myself getting better at trance or actually perceiving things happening a lot more automatically and without conscious input. That felt the most impactful because it instilled a lot of confidence that I CAN go under fully.

**KEEPING NOTES OF CHANGES / ANYTHING I AM FEELING**  

It is harder to abuse my body /  More inclined to do loving action towards myself.  

I don't know when that change began in our sessions, but its effect is pronounced. I can literally *feel* something stronger inside of myself moving me towards the compassionate choice for myself.  e.g.

I remember being stressed one night and the temptation to emotionally eat was incredibly compelling. I literally had the item in hand - and then something surfaced inside of me that was *WAY* stronger that immediately made me put it down.

This will also sound like a little thing... but I will brush my teeth now every evening no matter how exhausted I am. It's that same feeling that surfaces when I am tempted to just go to bed.

The temptation to abuse stimulants has dissipated. In the past, I would be so anxious about being productive that I would use various stimulants to keep myself going. I have no desire to do that now.  

I am honestly more inclined to take listen to your Midday Destress file when I start to feel tired and that does wonders.

This is raw what I wrote immediately after session:  
  
> What do I feel right now?
> Lost.
> How do I want to feel?
> More confident in what I am doing - to see the big picture, because I know when I am tunnel-visioned
> There is a maladaptive belief-system I am wrestling with still
> I want to foster confidence inside myself.
> I want to be clear.
> I will do anything to free myself from the trauma. I am literally willing to be brainwashed and remade in that effort.

> A negative self-perception of self. Skews the way you see the world.
> You showed me that firsthand.
> I want to be able to FEEL again; that the actions I do *are* important and are positive.
> I want to see all the good that I bring the world.  

> driving to therapy the subsequent day and noticing I am horny. Like for the entirety of the day I was feeling tingliness in my clit  
  
> I need to figure out what is really me. What is genuine?
> I am very caught up in how I am coming off to other perceptions  
> That it distorts how I would naturally act  

> ^^^ I think this is also why voice is a little bit stressful sometimes during phone calls you. It's hard to juggle modifying my voice and holding a genuine conversation.
> I feel like when I am relaxed in trance, I can't control my voice as well, and it makes me self-conscious, in a way that interferes with letting go of control completely during hypnosis.  
> 
> I *in part* want to sound feminine because I want to be seen as a women by you. I understand I am not a cis women and that's okay. I guess I want to have perceived value by you still, and I am attributing that in part to gender for some reason.

**Helpful information about me that I want to convey:**

- I think I have always been the type of person that prefers to be thorough. This means that it will *sometimes* take me time during a session to feel confident about an experience / determination.  
I'm letting you know because I have been prone to rushing a process, when I perceive I am taking too long for the other person. i.e. people-pleasing behavior.  

I believe this is a BIG source of why I feel so conflicted internally the subsequent day, as I was not allowing things to happen at their own rate in certain incidences.  

I need reminders that I don't need to force anything to happen but to just to enjoy myself, and if things happen that's great - and if they don't that's fine too. It REALLY has the effect of absolving myself of the preconceived expectations I put onto myself, and then I find I rapidly end up dropping into trance more automatically.    

I want to continue building confidence in the belief that I can stay in trance, even when I am thinking more cerebrally. Can you continue to teach that to me?  

I have a preconceived notion that if I am actively thinking that it will disrupt trance. I have since seen, that's not entirely true. I recall you described it as thinking about gravity doesn't actually change it, which was a helpful analogy. 🙂

**What am I consciously incorporating:**

- Intention:  I'm asking myself what is the Intention of every action as much as possible. There's still more I can apply this too but I am proud of incorporating it so far. It's really helpful viewing actions from this lens.

- Apologies:  I will not apologize, unless it's actually warranted. It's an impulse and very reflexive - and it's a feminine thing to do. However, it's not healthy or appropriate. It's an excuse and a deflection. I felt guilty is the cause, and the apology is the symptom.

- Honesty:  I need to be more honest about how I am feeling. Diminish, "Kind of/Maybe/Sort of/I guess". It's not being honest. It's plausible deniability. Sometimes you genuinely don't know but often times I am doing this behavior because it *feels* superficially safer.

### Post Session 4

**Please describe everything that you remember from the session:**

Honestly, I don't remember a large percentage of the session. I mostly just know remember the pre-talk, and the focus of topic for the session (self acceptance, and identity).

**Things I noticed immediately after the session:**

Unconscious Punishment / Reward System:

> oh. god.  
> i tried to say i h*** myself  
> while driving alone

**How the session made me feel:**  

Note: This was in the days following the session.

> There is a random tension that sometimes services surfaces
> It feels like I'm in a stabilization. There is no judgment towards myself, thoughts, feelings - But there is a lot of processing occurring. I noticed while driving that typically I would have had more anxiety i.e. thinking of more negative possibilities. It's a complete absence of anxiety I presume because it understands that I will be okay, no matter what the future holds.

**Identity**

**Gender**

**Hesitation for choosing a label...**

1. They're all confining. I am just *me*. The label is only useful in conveying information about ourselves automatically to others - but it is extremely broad and subjective in what it communicates. The label is based on society's common consensus of its meaning and is still riddled with individual subjectivity.
2. I am hesitant to choose a label other than woman or man. I believe the need for connection is a *strong*​ human driving force and certainly for me with my background. I didn't want to be an obscure outlier in gender identity and alienate myself and indirectly create a feeling of being an outcast.   
  
**Options that surfaced...**

- I gravitated towards women label for a number of reasons... BORN OUT OF PROTECTIVE MECHANISMS

- Prior to transitioning, I hated getting treated as a threat automatically for being perceived as a man. Retaining, the label femboy still subjects me to that I feel like.
- I had NO freedom to emotionally express myself in the way that I wanted. I felt like, as a man, I was confined to an extremely limited range of *permittable* emotional expression. If I deviated from what was expected of that label I would get reprimanded by society.
- In a similar vein, I could not wear the clothes that seemed more appealing / fun to me. Men's clothing feels extremely restrictive (it's getting better). However, it's still not what feels 'right' to me to wear.

- It is such a strong negative response to imagine myself in masculine clothes. So I think that's indicative of something. I am really trying to keep an open mind with visualizing and I can't seem to get past it. So I think that's a real 'no'. That is real, that I prefer feminine expression.

- This is fucked up but I prefer getting treated better. 

- The alternative option that I am surprised felt completely fine was the label "femboy" or "twink". I think based on appearance and mannerisms this is the archetype I probably most loosely fall into.

- Being a woman meant having community, not sure if I would still have that with this label.
- More to say on this topic...

**Conclusions...**

- You have helped me accept the masculine energy I also possess. This has enabled me to express myself much more freely - and without being self-conscious anymore. You helped me accept a part of myself that I didn't even realize I was shoving down.

**Sexuality-**

- I realized I had/have an internalized prejudice. If I was a woman than dating a man was more socially acceptable. I am very concerned in what other's think. What's going to minimize the maximize the reach people. I have come to terms I am bisexual and have an attraction leaning towards men right now, which I attribute partially to hormone replacement therapy.

**KEEPING NOTES OF CHANGES** 

I spent more or less the entire day fluctuating from states of what I would call extreme internal conflict, and now my brain is just churning out the messages that I need internalized.  

I am observing there is a root issue, from which everything else is stemming from. It's not totally addressed because I find it keeps surfacing in the form of anxious thought patterns / feelings. I take a lot of comfort in the fact that I do feel *drastically* different since beginning hypnotherapy sessions with you. So I know I'm moving in a positive direction and that these ideas that are surfacing are my unconscious trying to point me in the right direction.

The root issue I suspect is I still need to *feel* safe on a deep, fundamental level. That _I will be okay_. I have a strong suspicion that this is the Achilles heel Jenga block. The safety mechanism is hardcoded in isn't tuned to what's a realistic threat.

It could also be because of the job insecurity is such a big thing but I am trying to remember that something great will happen on the horizon.

It's okay to feel good. I deserve to feel pleasure and it is GOOD for me.

I need to know 'why' it is good for me, in order to believe it.
I am realizing this is what has interfered with pleasure triggers or any orgasm command. It's almost an aversion to what I perceive as hedonism and feeling like I don't deserve it on an innate level.

I've been working at it recently and have had some breakthroughs which I have been proud of. 😊 I was listening to X and trying to focus on being 'more' open to those types of triggers. I felt powerful but fleeting responses in my body. Nothing sustainable and nothing I could control.

I believe this will be a *very* effective convincer of hypnosis because the first time an orgasm command ever worked on me (courtesy of X), I had absolutely no control of it and it was undeniably strong. I have not been able to achieve that since, even with same audio file.

I have a fantasy getting 'owned' in that way. I want someone to just say a word and be dropped to my knees wracked with pleasure and actually realize the vast the discrepancy in power is and realizing how controlled I really am.

I feel like there's also such an ability for rewiring in this state. I remember the last time I had a body(?) orgasm from an audio file I felt very programmable. It like overrides everything else the pleasure is so blinding.

> i deserve to feel pleasure now
> but i don't know how to consistently trigger it
> i need to be comfortable with you facilitating
> how can i rationalize, put my mind at ease
> how do i surrender

- I can trust my intuition.

- YES. THIS. VISUALIZE / FEEL WHAT YOUR INTUITION IS LIKE.
- The anxiety comes from the doubt in my own instinct placed on me from numerous people in the past. I need to see  how good my intuition actually is.  

- It's okay to be me. It's okay to express myself IN ANY WAY.

- It needs an addendum.  

- I don't need to be sure about something. I don't have to be perfect. I don't have to know something perfectly to do something. I am not perfect and that's okay

- specificity. break down the core elements. It needs an addendum, so that it feels accurate / right. Do you have suggestions? I say this one because I frequently deal with analysis paralysis and perfectionism tendencies. I don't know where the line is between striving for greatness versus settling.  
  
- I will not let other people UNFAIRLY make me feel like a bad person.

- I'm a beautiful person (inside and out).

### Post Session 5

**Please describe everything that you remember from the session:**

**Breathing Induction**

the breathing thing was effective!!!! i FELT that. _wish i spent more time losing myself in that feeling, instilling it deeply in_

**  
Breakdown:** I remember the initial induction with the breathing exercise and accompanied mantra. I was surprised to actually *FEEL* the control being relinquished to you. I didn't know that feeling was possible. It's like opening a door to a new world of possibilities.

**Storyline / Visuals**

> THE INITIAL DOOR INTO MIND WAS SERIOUSLY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING
> when i said it was "stunning". i was actually floored.
> my unconscious generated the door completely automatically  
> it embodied everything i found beautiful in nature
> it was sunflower sort of wooden engraving, very intricate
> i wish i could depict it, in a way that did it justice  

> _lessons extremely excited for. all the curriculum!!_  

**Breakdown:** This made me feel most excited. The learning aspect.

> the women who met me at bed. soft kisses? feeling confused/mixed to have someone serve me. never had that. 

**Breakdown:**  

> _gold collar I WANT_

**Breakdown:**

**Things I noticed:**

**How the session made me feel:**

**Amorous:**

absurdly horny. i can't remember ever feeling this *kind* of arousal. it's different. it's like this YEARNING. as i look at my boyfriend's skin

i can feel that i am wet and have been for some quite sometime without realizing it.

**Pride / Joy:**

so much self acceptance afterwards!!!!! i feel so connected to myself right now. i'm looking in the mirror and thoroughly loving the person i see 🙂🙂🙂

> best session EVER. omg
> committing this to memory forever
> trying to remember every detail
> every compliment you gave me  
> and internalize them
> - one deviation(?) above average intelligence. much better, at noticing patterns and correlation than typical person
> - i am naturally submissive i think is what he said. i literally just want a quote of it. i felt extremely proud for any praise. any acknowledgement.

**Breakdown:** This pride is coming from at least two different places that I can discern.

1.) When you have a sense of worship for someone, it has a way of making their words more meaningful. In a similar vein, you seem very *intentional* with your words, which has the effect of making the praise you *do* give feel objectively factual.

2.) I have struggled to see myself through a clear lens for a long time. Your comments to me feel impactful because you are showing my strong suits. It's empowering me and makes me want to build on my good qualities.

**Peaceful / Relaxed:**  

> noticing I am completely in present afterwards and RELISHING it. i am never this relaxed.
> i can actually instinctively react to people
> i am completely experiencing the moment live, without anything to BLOCK/inhibit the experience
> I'M EXPERIENCING, NOT ANTICIPATING

**Concern / Confliction:**

> AAAA CONFLICTED ABOUT PATH I AM GOING DOWN
> there are things happening that i can't take back
> not bad change
> but am concerned about growing apart from some people i cherish
> because my world views are shifting in a radical way
> how do i even broach these topics with friends and loved ones?
> it feels like incomprehensible to contemporary society
> my trans friends would be appalled at my growth and my cis friends would be confused or skeptical of me. it's frustrating. it feels like my experience is going to get trivialized or not taken seriously regardless.  
> this is my anticipation, given what i know about people. i COULD be wrong. but that's my prediction

**Breakdown:** The world view you are showing me is contradiction to what is socially accepted model. Hypnosis is such an esoteric that it is hard for anyone in my immediate life to understand when I explain.

**KEEPING NOTES OF CHANGES**  

**Delayed aftershock!**

Why do hypnotic suggestions feel so much more potent after sessions? I've noticed this is a trend from some audios before. Like a delayed aftershock! I find I can go back to X now and feel wracked with pleasure to differing degrees. It feels comparable to a trigger, in that, I can 

**Unconscious synchronicity:**

> my unconscious is like in autopilot mode. it's a complete stream of consciousness
> like i am typing this automatically
> it feels like my hand is not my own
> but rather acting as the conduit!!!
> Breakdown: I was typing so fast on my phone I was struck how quckly I was moving without
> it's going fast without me having to think about it

Gender identity/pronouns:

i said he/him for myself and that felt fine actually

cool!

i still care if other's don't use pronoun but it's more rooted in a respect thing

like i only care if they are doing it intentionally out of spite.

like i could be open to even discussing it. but they dont' wnat to even listen

not sure how to broach with people in my life

boyfriend wants to view me as a women because that's probably easier on his identity. the same way it was for me. because internalized prejudice i believe i have since worked through since coming to terms with being bisexual and accepting femboy/trans girl label. 

right section for this. or under relevations. or something else

still prefer getting called a good girl she/her

but goodboy at least in theory feels hot because of how i could be changed in that way. and can't even resist or be mad about it because of how much better it feels. oh how adamantly against that change i am yet

how

i am a bisexual femboy

that's okay

but i prefer she/her or being called a good girl

gender fluid instead of trans when

i like hormones being soft

don't want to subject my body to another flip flop

this feels like the compassionate choice i feel tenderly in my heart

not ideal. but feels like i will be okay continue liking this  

**Breakdown:** It depends what we mean by impactful  

**Breakdown:** this is the deepest i think i've ever gone. maybe one other audio file from X put me this deep. ugh make accurat

It's actually weird looking back at text messages that weren't even *that* long ago and feeling like it was an entirely different person

Gifts From Unconscious. Revelations.

**Pursuit Knowledge / Truth / Intelligence**

> thought surfacing
> 'i am designed to know things'
> what does that mean
> a constant desire to understand. it is not satisfied with not knowing the answer to something. it can't be placated in that way.

> i would always rather know truth even if it's hard
> that is some internal drive inside me
> has never stopped me no matter how hard the truth or reality is
> that is what has spurred all these sessions
> i have to see this through. i have to know what's on the other side

**Breakdown:** Ohhh I realized afterwards this was my unconscious telling me something true or integral about myself. Regarding what aspect of session? Figuring out who I am.  

mood quadrupled

proud of when answered the question about truth being destroyed. demonstrating something about yourself in that moment

Gender

i see the masculine and feminine more clearly in me

the masculine i want to say is my logic, relentless drive to succeed make sense of the world thrive, the desire to protect/provide is also there. protect people i care about by showing support. love. provide in a financial sense through career. **does like having power which blows me away? i did not think I'd like that**

my feminine is my heart more freed. it's a playfulness. it's loving and kind. it's sensitive but strong. a willingness openness to be vulnerable. desire for connection. tenderness. support.

(acknowledging these are not totally gender-specific qualities but you get the gist)

ohhh change observed.

gotten more comfy wearing some masculine clothing items. i would not do often do that

i relegated myself to skirts dresses cuz i wanted to be viewed as a women without any chance

but now wearing sweatpants and crop tops.

feels comfortable and like me still  

and build on my own points

while integrating his

build accuracy further

  

like how i imagine he'd want me to

"if it can be destroyed by the truth then it deserves to be"

i wouldn't want to destroy anything he creates, but i want to contribute

i think i have good ideas

no i know i do

but i also know i have an infinite distance to cross. A LOT further to go, if i am even going to come close to standing on a similar terrain as him

to see the world as he does

god i hope this isn't come off poorly.

there is an earnest desire to be a part of this

DEFINING EACH:

femininity to me means vulnerability. a lighter heart. but that's not EXCLUSIVELY true.

WHAT ARE THE UNIVERSAL TRAITS

kindness?

compassion?

sensitivity?

feminine self is more expressive. there is something integral to that emotional variability. volatility.  

i know what both systems look like because i have experienced both

but existing in an estrogen system for so long has eroded my memory of how i FELT and thought in a testosterone system.

i KNOW they feel different. i remember that distinctly early on. when i started taking estradiol tablets. i literally felt the mental landscape shift.

hormones are steroids lipid-soluble. which means they readily can cross the blood brain barrier upon ingestion. that's why you could feel "something" different mentally.

i believe it is possible to draw out the defining features of femininity and masculinity through a biological basis by drawing out the trends in each headspace. in the behaviors.


feels like sleep is elusive after sessions

my brain is spinning still

thinking. processing.

i went out to the balcony

I got a flashback I think when I was before a teenager

out front of my house standing on a rock and loving life, the energy of the world

waiting for the school bus

this feels similar to right now

the feeling of being present again

I am always continually surprised how there are LEVELS of being present

I started off largely dissociated

And as our sessions have progressed I think I reached a more present state

Intimacy

i actually enjoyed receiving pleasure like by fucking someone or getting blown. that's interesting. still feels uncomfortable to say. so is that sexual shame or something else. ohhh. no it's cuz i haven't expressed these before. new kind if vulnerability.

**two types of pleasure trigger:**

One is more inwardly involved but harder to trigger and it's the preferred feeling. It's the feeling of being controlled and submissive

localized frenulum, tits

butterfly feeling? in stomach too?

can be triggered when i... remember you hypnotizing me with eyes, i am back in the moment, the feeling


The other one is more like getting chills
sort of easier
grade them

DIFFICULTY
TWO TRIGGERS
DIFFERENTIATOR??


OH MY FUCKING GOD. i just realized that session fixed my sexual shame

i realized i am looking at my body with total acceptance and everyone else's body

it's like i'm seeing myself as a sexual being

identity shift is occurring


okay so i can't believe i forgot this. or that i am just connecting this now.
but as a kid, i remember mind control being a theme in the make-believe scenarios i would imagine when playing with toys i had.
specifically i was obsessed with X for some reason. i had a X.
i also liked collecting gemstones.
but i had X and i had scenarios where there was X.
and using it to control other X? a plot line.

difficulty falling asleep initially kept smiling

curled up cozy in bed in afternoon waking up so happy
got this relaxed glow waking up at 2 p.m.
happy clear optimistic
enigmatic smile

how do i surrender. i'm not losing myself ENTIRELY or for prolonged periods of time. comes back to loose conscious awareness, as soon as i become aware i start slipping
the original audio file is only one i was gone, gone.
i come close sometimes
but variability


****oh. the memory of the X ages ago.****

okay, so this is one i have wanted to tell you for a while now.

it occurred after one of our sessions. the timeline is hazy about when exactly.
but i was asleep and must have been dreaming. but there was a moment when i came into lucidness
there was a symbol and colors with it
i watched as it changed
a X, a X,
colors were like X
not in this order. i cannot recall the full iteration or all the details
that makes me sad

it felt like
it sincerely feels like one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. It embodied everything I found beautiful in life
Things I never thought about
Things all coalesced together into one moment
I watched the symbol unfold and change. Meld into each other and grow.

**It literally felt like "processing".** But this was the visual embodiment of it

### Gender and Transitioning

I haven't told anyone this story before. I hope you can listen with an open mind as I go through it.

Detransition feels like it is looked at with nearly as much scrutiny, as choosing to transition in the first place does (depending on which side of the fence you are on). When I decided to begin Hormone Replacement Therapy I didn’t  **fully** know the driving forces that brought me to this stage. Daniel would later help me understand those life-changing moments in a way that felt so intrinsically true that it was hard to deny on a fundamental level.

I suppose that's part of the reason I've been putting this off because it's probably hard to acknowledge that. But where do I begin? So I guess when I started transitioning, it was when I first started contemplating transitioning. Well, I first started exploring my gender when I tried on my friend's anime schoolgirl outfit. His buddies had got it for him as a joke.

It was ultra pink and cutesy. But as soon as I saw it at his house, I was immediately and suddenly excited to try to wear it. So much so that when he left the house, I did put it on and was struck by how good I felt wearing it. And that prompted me to start exploring, I guess, to chase chasing that feeling, actually, because I was like, oh, this felt really good. It's natural to kind of follow those positive experiences.

And so when, what happened? Fast forward, I'm just trying on clothes, and I'm like, okay. Like, finding, like, what works for me and what I don't like. And all the time, it must I must have been processing still. And I don't really know where the push came from.

I know in social media, the trans thing was kind of gaining was gaining some traction.

I was still in my undergraduate at college and I didn't. And at the time, I told myself, like, okay. I'm just gonna try this. And if it doesn't feel good or if I don't like it, then I'll stop. But I found I was getting happier the more I was doing it.

It's such a long story, and I need to speed it up. **Basically, what Daniel helped me understand is, I hated myself on some level, and that that's such a hard reality for anyone to admit to themselves that you are blindsided by it.**

And so over the course of first sessions, Daniel helped heal my trauma and helped me love myself fully and see what a beautiful person I am and all my unique and good qualities and also, some of my shortcomings or areas that I want to improve in. He highlighted the areas I wanted to improve in, strive in, and grow in. 

Basically, as soon as I he helped me stop hating myself or helped reconcile, like, the gender stuff, then the dysphoria I had been feeling for so long since transitioning, and it only really started it it became more pronounced in transition, if anything, because you're in this, like, weird in between awkward limbo stage where you're not really one thing and you're not really the other.

And it's an uncomfortable point to be in, Like, that, like, isolation or that outsider, that state. And, yeah, it's just, it's stunning. I don't know. It made me reconsider everything. I mean, I could talk about how my dad growing up was extremely controlling and emotionally, I'd say, abusive.

I don't I don't like saying that out loud or admitting. No. It's not admitting. I don't like saying that out loud because I don't want to be disrespectful towards him. It's not really disrespectful.

What is it? I don't know. He's my dad. His emotional abuse wasn't his, like, only quality. It was just one aspect of him.

He had good things too. Not to diminish one or the other. It's just no one would paint him like a villain. But the point with this is my dad was extremely controlling with my family and also had a tendency to be very emotionally volatile, unpredictable, anxious. And the consequence of that was, I tried I remember being at a young age, and I think I tried fighting back with him, and that didn't work.

Like, he just blew up harder on me. And then I tried running away, and that didn't work either. And then I remember fawning, and fawning seemed to work. And, unfortunately, this is a commonality I think a lot of trans femmes can exist, can relate to with their dads, but sometimes their moms too. But it's this feeling of with that fawning reaction is a more feminine reaction of the other 3 or the other 2 rather.

And it's just a more submissive action. You never had a positive male role model. If anything, you had an anti male role model, and that's how I felt about my dad. I didn't wanna be anything like him because he made me feel so miserable. And, like, people I mean, as a kid, people expect you to, like, wanna be like your dad.

The son is expected to wanna kind of, like, admire their dad and the daughter, like like, look to their mom as their, like, role model or guidance. I don't know. 
I just think a lot of people that transition don't realize the reasons they're doing it. 

I did things I never thought I would do.

---

What else can I say? Daniel helped me accept the masculine and feminine in me. This is something I had been struggling with endlessly, but could not could not realize had zero self awareness about.

I did not realize the source of the dysphoria was the lack of self acceptance, but also the acknowledgment that masculine energy is equally as part of me as the feminine energy because we all embody both. But in the process, what a lot of people don't realize when they transition is they are consciously trying to shut out anything masculine because there is so much pain associated with it. And the issue with that is the masculine is not intrinsically bad, but we have learned to associate it for transfeminine people. We've learned to associate it as bad through conditioning, through society, and our personal experiences in life. I know to some people reading, that must be they're probably in uproar or discontent over that notion, but I swear to god it's true.

So much of transition is fuelled, unfortunately, by a strong, a lack of self love and transition sometimes is a way of becomes manifest itself, surfaces as a way of resolving that pain and trauma because, one, you're assuming a new sort of identity. You're separating this new self from your old self in some in some capacity because we associate being a man with being in pain. And what else can I say? To caveat this, that doesn't mean you can't be feminine or wear feminine clothes because I certainly still do. I feel more comfortable and confident in that presentation, but I'm not shutting out my masculine energy anymore, and I am so much better for it.

I can actually articulate and express myself clearly and properly, and that is a great feeling because before you I had zero respect, and now I actually have some respect. And it's a refreshing feeling when you've lacked it for ages. With transition, what Daniel helped me understand, over the course of the hypnotherapy sessions, it started to become clear the source of the gender dysphoria in my life and why I transitioned. I identified that I NEVER had a positive male role model in my life. My dad was so detestable to me that I wanted to be nothing like him even at a very early age, and thus, I gravitated more towards my mom in conjunction with this, because I did not embody the traditional masculine values as a kid, that had the consequence of alienating me from my male peers.

However, the woman in my in my life, were kinder, and that was a refreshing thing to experience. And thus, you learn to associate femininity with goodness because they're just nice to you. And all these things factor in together. 

Cycling back to my dad for a moment, he was emotionally abusive, unfortunately, but the consequence of this is that for me to survive, I had to fawn a lot. There are 4 trauma responses, fight, flight, freeze, and fawn.

The last one, fawn, is essentially you're placating someone or appeasing someone so they don't get angry or to keep yourself safe, but it's intrinsically a very submissive and passive behaviour. In other words, a more feminine one in some ways. And thus, that also further conditioned me towards femininity or transitioning. And then we saw in the social media a rise of awareness surrounding it, which I don't think that's intrinsically bad, but I know it I started at the time, I was just wearing clothes that I thought were cute, and I was like, okay. Like, I was fine with that.

But then I started to get these different sentiments saying, like, oh, if you like to wear clothes, then you must be trans and you must, like, you have to do hormones to be your best self or, like, whatever. You won't ever, like, be truly living your best life. Oh, that was the sentiment. Judgment. Yeah.

And so and then I started hormones, and I can I had rationalized to myself, like, I'm just gonna try this? And if I don't like it, then I'll stop. And if it's good, then I'll keep going. But I went into it with trying to keep with as little expectations as possible. But you sort of become a self fulfilling prophecy or a caricature, an archetype in the process.

I had unintentionally adopted the label trans as my identity and woman as my identity, and those were intrinsically limiting, confining, and they weren't totally who I was. They were something else projected onto me, which I had then unknowingly internalized that I had to meet those standards and live up to that. And so I was extremely caught up with being perceived as a woman or feminine. I already had some naturally feminine tendencies, but now it was, like, to the nth degree, trying to just be recognized with, a falsetto that maybe wasn't my natural comfortable tone or maybe wearing something that was maybe a little bit too ultra feminine for the occasion or inappropriate for the occasion because I was still getting caught up with being perceived as a woman. Yeah.

Now I identify as I don't really have a label for it. I still am not a big fan of labels, but I've been using the term gender fluid with people because I see myself fluctuate between these different states of a more masculine energy and a more feminine energy. I'll present sometimes tomboyish, but there's always a hint of feminine in it, and I'm happy with that. There's a certain, like, comfort or joy in that femininity. 

**I see myself in the mirror sometimes, and I love who I am.**

Before Daniel, I would look in the mirror, and I could not even grasp how distorted my view of myself was. I could think that I understood and knew, but, I was genuinely impossible before him to fully fathom how distorted my view was. Because now I can see myself just as I see all the other people in my life. Because all the other people in my life, I love them and see them for the human that they are, both their good and their bad. Whereas with me, prior to Daniel, I would look in the mirror, and all I would see is the flaws.

I would think I'd be seeing my strengths, but I wasn't really feeling my strengths if you catch my drift. There's a distinction between acknowledging something at the conscious level and feeling it at the unconscious level. 

Only by becoming aware of the internal forces inside of yourself can you truly become conscious is what I've come to realize. Because so much of our life is dictated by automatic impulses that we perceive to be conscious but are rather just instilled into us, whether by others or ourselves.

### People Affected by My Changes and their Comments

I was briefly going to talk about the different people who have noticed changes in me. So and I'm gonna caveat this and say that, these people who commented on it, I didn't tell them anything beforehand, mostly for my own curiosity. I was curious if anyone would perceive a difference and what that difference would be. And, I guess the first one that comes to mind is my Mom. My Mom said I mean, she spent a long, long time worrying about me, especially when I was in my eating disorder.

She she saw me at my at my worst moments when I was most depressed and most most trapped in life. And she last time I was over at her house and we were chatting, she said something to the effect of, like, "I'm so glad you're doing better now. I can really see it, and I know you're on the right track. Tell tell Daniel thank you for me". And yeah.

So that was one thing. I had a friend I met for coffee. She's a trans woman, but she she thought I was a lot more laid back, just more relaxed than she's ever really seen me before. And that was really comforting because I had so many moments with her.

I would just get anxious, and I was fine with her this time, way way more expressive and just, I don't know, just present, not caught up with what the right thing is to say, just being myself and still being cognizant, of course, of, like, people's feelings. 

My partner overheard me take a phone call one day with the pharmacy, and this was immediately after a session with Daniel. But, my partner was like, "I have never heard you sound so professional and concise before", and I was like, why thank you. 

And it was cool because I I could it's like my mind was working better. I could organize and just I don't know. I could infer what the other person like, what they needed to hear immediately in that moment. They'll there's I feel like there's a level of intuition that resides within us, but is sometimes locked away.

And maybe what Daniel does in his work is a little bit of unlocking us from the things that have held us in chains or in prisons. That being said, though, being being shackled doesn't sound like the worst thing to me anymore. I don't I don't know if it sounded like the worst thing to me before, but this was a way stronger desire to, I suppose be a slave than ever really existed before. And I think that's honestly, like, I'm smiling kind of as I say it, but I think it's cool. There's a sort of, a one a sense of wonder I'm feeling when I think about it, just how much I've changed that just my desires even like that have changed in such a way.

I do think think there's well, Daniel corrected me before. It's not empowerment. It's exalting a submissive. I think empowerment is like raising one above another, perhaps.

My best friend, X, she saw me. It felt like we were peers or like we were equals, and that was a really nice feeling. She did notice that I seemed more present and relaxed. I think that's the overall arching thing people tend to notice. 

**I have a random tangent thought, but I think the the perception of being present and relaxed stems from the extraction or removal of the the constant self deprecation or no ... It's criticism. It's the hyper criticalness that is present in a lot of anxious people, I would say, in regards to their own actions.** So when Daniel helped me be less hypercritical of myself and kinda just reminded me like, oh, you're a human. It's okay to express yourself.

You don't have to be any, like, certain way. Just do do what makes you happy. Be someone you would be proud of, that the people in your life would be proud of. Give back. Oh, fuck. Now I'm crying again. Happy tears.

### Conversations about Gender

Yeah. The the symbols thing is so fucking cool. I could talk about that another time. It'll be too long. But the abbreviated version is the reason I don't, describe the symbols always is, like, I'm not kidding when I say it's just certain geometry.

I still remember some of the symbols, and I I don't even know how to describe them. It's just it's shapes, and then the shapes have certain energy or they interface with certain shapes. But I've always been very into geometry as a kid. Yeah. Fractals.

Yeah. I think they're lovely, beautiful.

**I think for a lot of trans people, the driving force for hormones or whether it's surgery, it's one part acknowledgment because you've you've convinced yourself you wanna be or, like, you're a certain way and you you wanna be seen as for who you are, which is very natural.**

I think we all wanna be seen for who we are. And we use visual cues, auditory. Like, there's so many things that go into how we gender a specific person. Many of them are kind of unconscious because they show up so automatically in the people we interact with. And so hormones or sometimes surgeries become this, this driving force for the recognition people are yearning for.

Or it's another aspect of it of it is is, when you're trans, like, when you're you've been on hormones, but you don't quite pass perfectly or you're a little bit in that weird in between stage, it's an uncomfortable point for a lot of people. And it's because you're not really one or the other, and you can perceive it and feel it from others when they interact with you. 

They don't really know what to make out of you. It depends on the person, of course, but, this is, this is, I mean, I've I've met people, and they're they they just seem, like, weirded out with me just right off the bat. And it's a like, that that hurts just because it's not, like, something you're trying to control, but I found that was a driving force for, the facial feminization surgery I considered before because, like, I perceived certain aspects of my face as, like, masculine.

Yeah. So I thought my jawline was masculine, but then I came to see, like, oh, there's cis women that have, like, like, a similar jawline as me. I've done that. But then also through the change work that Daniel has done with me, I found that like, when I actually look in the mirror now, I actually, like well, I just love myself as opposed to immediately being ashamed or feeling, like, a a sort of disdain or dislike for how my face looks.

I just like how I look now. Like, it's not necessarily I guess, I don't I don't necessarily view it as feminine or masculine. I'm just me, and I see someone beautiful. And that's a good change. And what else can I say?

I think that's, I think that's a really beautiful gift to give, give people. 

And it's a powerful like, your three line thing, like, the love yourself as much as you love everyone else in your life. That took a while for it to, like because when you told it to me, I understood it, like, in a very, I don't know, like, a superficial way.

Like, maybe intellectual yes. 

But where I'm going with this is, I remembered, like, I don't know. There was one day I was at the gym and I looked at it in the mirror and it clicked for me, like, oh, I'm doing it. Like, I'm perceiving myself as as, like, I would perceive, like, another person that I love and cherish, like, in terms of, like, what do I need right now to take care of myself? 

There's it it encompasses so many things in one simple way.

I've always kind of been too that they were there. Like, I like, the tiger in the cage with Ishmael, and, like, how I could sense that, like, it was trapped or that there was, like, a better way to live. And I I could always feel these things in my life or the one veil would come down, and I'd be like, wow. That was really humbling. I'm glad I can see this now.

### Work and Holding a Job

The way I was operating was just simply an inferior way of being. That might sound very harsh at first to someone else listening in, but to have this perspective now looking back on the past, it's plain as day. I wasn't functioning well in the world because my natural configuration at the time was just suboptimal. Daniel essentially went into my mind and tweaked the settings is what it feels like sometimes and configured me in a good way where now I can just be happy in life and also make more substantial and natural progress in whatever catches my fancy, whether that's work or a relationship or whatnot. It's almost unbelievable sometimes to the old me would never believe the things I've done.

The old me would be, I would describe as shocked, suspicious, and concerned over the me that I am now, but there would be a part of them that would also be a small part of them that would be deeply curious or intrigued. To give some examples about how I'm different now, I used to live in a chronic sense, a chronic state of constant self doubt. It wasn't even something that I could control because I knew it wasn't good for me, but I couldn't really effectively stop myself from doing it until Daniel intervened. That sense of self doubt permeated every area of my life where I couldn't start any task because I wasn't sure if it was the right action to do, or I was afraid of failing, and nothing ever really got done. **I couldn't hold a job down before Daniel, and now I've found the best job of my life, honest to God, because this is the most I've ever been compensated by far.**

And it's something I'm actually in the first job I've been extremely passionate about, and I couldn't do that before. I would last at jobs for a while, but eventually that maladaptive negative core belief would prompt me to self sabotage in some capacity, and then my life would fall apart, and then I would build myself back up again from the scratch. But that shaky feeling of fear inside never quite went away because I knew it was such a theme reiterating itself in my life. I knew I desperately wanted to get away from it. I had thrown my head 1000000 different ways, more numerous than I can count.

And I would always make some progress, but it never seemed I would always learn something, but it never seemed to completely dissipate. It would always reiterate itself. And it wasn't until Daniel that I could fix this. Because I cannot stress to people enough how devastating being in a cycle can be, whether that cycle is an eating disorder, abusive relationships, addiction. It's so denigrating to be aware of a problem inside yourself and striving to fix it and it'd be ineffectual. It destroys your self esteem day by day, chip by chip.

### Eating Disorder, Sexual Shame and Reclaiming Sexuality

I at the time of the eating disorder, I often equated it to death by a 1000 cuts because it's not exactly the food that kills you always, but rather the constant perceived failures day in and day out that slowly chip away any self esteem you had until you're left a hollow empty husk and have nothing else to and have convinced yourself you have nothing else to live for because you can't escape. And Daniel is that escape. He is literally the light at the end of the tunnel, a literal ray of hope. And I'm sure so many people's lives because he can literally fix your issues. I know to any number of people reading that they're probably extremely sceptical as I was because I certainly didn't think these things that had plagued me for years years years could disappear in the matter of overnight and through subsequent sessions get eviscerated.

I didn't realize this was possible, quite frankly. And that realization is both incredibly humbling and of oneself and awe inspiring and conjures a sense of awe inspiring towards Daniel that someone like this could exist in the world. You only have to listen to Daniel for, like, a couple of minutes for it to become immediately apparent that this person is different from everyone else. In his ability to see the world clearly in his calibre that he carries himself in every facet of his life. He, from my point of view, has honed himself into an impeccable human.

One of the concepts Daniel taught me or maybe I should talk about how I felt about pleasure before meeting him. So I think I stayed away from hedonistic things because I thought it was intrinsically bad to really relish in those feelings, in part because I had some trauma with it. And, like, for instance, like, with binge eating, for instance, it felt good momentarily, but it felt awful later. And then I had sexual shame too, I think, when I was younger. Whenever I got off, I always felt a deep sense of shame afterwards, especially when it was centred around certain kinks that I wasn't comfortable accepting.

---

And now after meeting him and going through the sessions, feel like a sexual being now. Daniel has a bit of a knack for that, of having, like, I guess, prompting, like, sexual awakenings in people because he really knows how to push your all the your buttons or all the buttons in just the right way. He has this deep understanding of it and this what I want to argue is a natural intuition or talent or proclivity for it. It feels like myself becoming a whole and complete person every day. I feel the process of that happening as all these aspects that were previously muffled, subdued, buried's the word, all these aspects that were either buried in myself or all disconnected from each other.

**Every day, I feel all these connections coming together and my me becoming a full and complete person because our sexuality is actually intrinsic to us.** I think something that lent a lot of credibility to Daniel to me before starting the sessions, but when I while I was still sceptical, so I'll backtrack. When I was listening to his podcast episode about asexuality, I was a bit on the fence about it at the time. I could logically see what he was talking about, and it was hard for me to deny the efficacy of that.

At the same time, I had identified as asexual for a long time because I just simply didn't have the impulses, thus, it's very natural to to begin to assume that, oh, I must be asexual, but rather what we should be asking ourselves or questioning ourselves, question everything, is why would I be asexual? Why don't I have these impulses? And the answer is a lot of sexual shame that gets put into you, so much so that you cannot even consciously recognize it, and thus it manifests in the form of your unconscious repressing it completely beyond your awareness ability to perceive it, awareness to see it. 

Arousal before transition or before arousal before hormone arousal before hormones versus after hormones is a vastly different experience. And when I started hormones, I didn't really feel anything up until I started listening to Daniel's voice. And at first, there wasn't a lot happening, in part, I think, because I was I had these protective walls up and I was thinking very consciously about it, and and thus, I wasn't really allowing it to effectively work because for hypnosis to work, it kind of requires a relinquishment of control, allowing and allowing your conscious mind to fade and your unconscious to flow over. 

And the first time I went into trance in an audio file was stunning. It was such a cool sudden experience that I was thrilled and captivated by what had just happened, and that, in part, spurred me to keep exploring hypnosis, eventually eventually culminating to me finding Daniel's podcast on Spotify, Mindkink, because I was really intrigued by this phenomena that I had no idea existed before and what the efficacy existed before and how it worked scientifically because I've always been a naturally inquisitive person.

And he was the first podcast I found that seemed like, wow. This person really knows what they're talking about. **I'm getting a bit derailed, but the point is, I didn't know pleasure could feel this good.**

I don't think I fully fathoms what, like, people who were, like, really overtly sexual or I couldn't fully wrap my brain around the behaviours until I felt them myself and their dictating force, their guiding force. This was included. It's probably a hard thing to admit. Probably because it's scary.

I mean, his work to me feels like an act of self love because the quality of my life is much better. I lost aspects of myself, and there is some grief or sorrow with that, but those aspects that were lost, I sometimes wonder whether they were really me or whether they were just beliefs put on to me. Our identity is way more malleable than I think we properly recognize, realize, and this is in part because it would it would be hard to admit that who we are is fundamentally in its nature dynamic, but I'm happy. I'm so happy.

Daniel has this ... Daniel makes you feel safe, Not simply in just in an emotional way, but in I don't know, just the way he carries himself. Like, if you could believe in anyone, you can believe in fucking Daniel because he's unlike anyone I've ever met before. It's a complicated feeling being changed, and I would advise that to anyone before undergoing this process that it will be a little bit earth shaking because you will change. You will succeed in whatever you're setting out to do.

My life is vastly less stressful now because I am not putting self imposed expectations on myself constantly at all times or shaming myself when something doesn't go exactly as planned. Now I'm just empowered, or I feel empowered every time. I don't perceive setbacks as setbacks anymore. I think that's describes it more adequately. Instead, I see it as an opportunity to learn and grow, which there's not that feeling attached with it, that constant shame or, discouragement.

That's a big change he provided me, and life's a lot stressful a lot less stressful now, and I see myself moving towards all of my goals simultaneously in tandem with each other because I'm moving forward in all these facets rather than getting stopped pre-emptively or prematurely by myself. Daniel literally unblocked me. I see myself moving forward in every facet of my life now, whereas before I had a self imposed handicap that I couldn't seem to overcome. Period. Before when before I had task or hobbies I wanted to do, but was too afraid to start them out of fear of failing or indecisiveness.

And now I find myself doing everything that calls to me or lights my heart up, and consequently see myself moving forward in all these areas in tandem with each other. A few examples, I've been trying to expand my vocabulary and so I'm passively looking for opportunities and and instances I can do that each day. I'm more consistent with my diet and workout now, and find that's passively moving me towards something I'm aspiring to be more effectively. I see myself at my job striving in every single little moment to learn as much as I can and find the areas to improve in. I wasn't like that before in my previous jobs.

I think I had a self destructive streak or a lack of self belief in my capabilities. And now with this job, even though it's a new position for me, I find myself striving my hardest and doing things I would have never done before. I find myself going to other departments within the building and other buildings and communicating with the personnel there, and asking them what would be helpful for my department to know? What would streamline the process for them more effectively? Where are there hiccups or roadblocks that aren't being discussed because what I've noticed working in X is that there seems there can be a lot of disconnect between departments and that creates complications.

And so the thought I had was why not be proactive in addressing this and trying to build rapport and connections with other people within the facility and create a stronger, more efficient environment. I can tell you with certainty, I would have never ever done that before, I would never have been that bold or confident. **And so to me, that's a very tangible thing Daniel has instilled into me. Period. An innate state of confidence or clarity in decisions.**

### Effectiveness of Hypnosis as a Mechanism

It is honestly disconcerting to me that hypnotherapy isn’t more widely recognized and readily available when it can be this effective and transformative in the hands of a skilled practitioner. There is an innumerable amount of people in the world who are hurting. So many people in our day-to-day lives that we can intuit are in pain and stuck in a cycle. Oftentimes they even realize it themselves on some level even if they don’t openly vocalize it to us.

We typically think the solution to problems in our own life, once we are aware of them, is simply a matter of willpower and putting in the effort - but what then, when you self-determine not repeating a behaviour and yet it keeps reiterating itself within your life? You begin to falsely believe that there’s something wrong with you. We can’t understand why we can’t seem to just stop. This has the sad effect of creating an incredible amount of self-shame.

I am here, in part, to tell you that you don’t have to be trapped. That the issue isn’t always a matter of a lack of desire but that these issues just simply AREN’T openly talked about. **That a problem rooted in the unconscious can’t be solved at the conscious level**. So of course we’re struggling with it. Daniel has both the knowledge and skill to resolve the issues.

---

So before I started hypnotherapy, I was just sceptical.

I I was desperate, but I was also sceptical because hypnosis seems like such an abstract concept and the impression I got was it's hard to study or hadn't seen a lot of research trials audit or the efficacy of it before. It gets the certain rep, bad rep, or lack of credibility rep in the media, but and I think those feelings bled into me. And so I went into it, like, wanting to give an open mind because it would be wasteful if I didn't. And so, like, when I did that first session and I came out of it, I was a bit shell shocked. **I remember looking in the mirror and being like or looking in the mirror afterwards in the bathroom and being like, what the fuck?**

How am I, like, am I really hypnotized? It's and there's this bubbly feeling of happiness and joy at that. And the reason I felt like I was hypnotized or rather was was because how I felt internally felt so dramatically differently compared to before the session. It's unlike any feeling you've ever had before. It's entirely novel.

**And, I mean, it was, I guess, it was also surprising, not surprising. I remember going out on the balcony in the early morning light and everything having this, like, crisp crisp new feeling to it. And in hindsight, that beauty must have always been there, but something was just obscuring it, and Daniel just took it away, put bluntly.**

And it's hard to wrap my mind around that still. Even actively right now as I write this, it's hard to actually conceptualize how much he's changed me because the changes are so invasive and wide and wide reaching. And that's not to sound scary when I say that. It's just objectively what it is, and the changes aren't bad changes. If anything, they're all objectively for the good.

If anything, the main feeling of confliction, for me at least, came from or rather stems from how disconcerting it is that I had been trapped in this feeling for years years years and could not get out of it. **And then to do one session with this man and come out of it with it effectively gone, it's it makes you start to question, like, why why isn't this more mainstream?** Why did this happen to me? Why How do people end up like this? Trapped in a cycle.

It's genuinely hard to comprehend how much he's changed me because for some strange reason that I cannot yet tease out but with hypnotherapy, as time goes on, it becomes excessively harder to remember how you used to think and used to feel even. But sometimes you'll have moments where you'll get flashbacks and you'll see the disparity between the you then and the you now.

One the flashback I got recently was before I remembered I would never make any claim that something good would happen or make some assertion of success. I would never make any assertion of success. Like, I would never say, like, oh, when the job interview goes good. I would always say, well, if if the job interview goes good or if this, if I manage to like, it was a lot of if statements and a lot of doubt. 

I don't even - maladaptive isn't even the right word. I had this negative belief system and I have no idea where it came from, but I had this innate belief that if I said something good would happen, I was jinxing it, which sounds so incredibly insane, silly, and factual to look back on now from this point of view. But I completely believed it before. And somewhere along the way, it just disappeared. And it's a much better change because now I can actually be like I can just say things will be good. No. I can speak freely without that anxiety, like, I'm jinxing it or gonna something bad's gonna happen. I used to think I was intrinsically self destructive. 

Having the eating disorder taught me that.

**And now I don't even think that anymore. I don't think I'm inherently self destructive. That is a good change.** 

Why is that a good change? Because I have so much more self control now. I'm way more happy because I'm not in this fear state of when will I collapse again? When will I self destruct? Now I'm just like, I'm not going to.

And it's like it sounds so matter of fact when I say it, that it almost sounds unbelievable. But it's just the truth. The plain simple truth. That's a bit that's a bit like what's the word? Too extra.

When I think about Daniel and his impact on my life, it's hard to know where to begin because the changes, he's instilled into me are so pervasive. 

Where do I begin with him? I don't think I've ever met someone more capable than Daniel. It's one of those phenomena where when you meet the person, you're you're immediately struck by it, that how the sense of I never knew someone like this could exist. I genuinely think he's the best in the world, and I've I've explored a LOT of different content creators and different hypnotists and their content.

Daniel, through helping me exploring my unconscious, helped me recognize the different ego states I had. He gave me a perception. He helped me see the different ego states that I existed in. And something about having that on that perception, that sensory awareness of the Unconscious Mind and the different states that fluctuates between has been incredibly helpful in my life. Because before, I would and as we frequently do, we enter certain moods or we shift into these different states so subtly and automatically that it's beyond our perceivable awareness, our peripheral awareness. And they can be incredibly dictating depending on what state is taking over. For instance for instance, let's say you have a protective mechanism that's an unhealthy or maladaptive negative belief system and it rears itself.

Having the awareness when you shift into the state can be incredibly grounding simply just because you can make sense of it, because you understand what's happening. In my own life, I can see myself shift between these different states. Sometimes I'll be in one state for a prolonged period of time, but when the shift happens, it's not quite as scary or jarring anymore. I just talk to that aspect of myself. And when I say talk, I mean in both a literal and figurative sense because these aspects inside of yourself, you can communicate with.

A lot of the times their feelings just need to be honoured. 

---

He has this almost unreal tenacity that becomes immediately apparent as soon as you listen to him talk. He has such a clear vision of the world and a deep understanding of these complex issues that interface our life, that no one has really proposed solutions to for before, at least not effective solutions. Medicine, psychiatric medication, it treats the symptoms, but it doesn't cure. It's more of a bomb than anything. In contrast, Daniel's hypnotherapy feels outright like a cure because I cannot tell you for how many years I I wrestled with anxiety I wrestled with anxiety and how it's interlaced every aspect of my life.

Anxiety is one of those things where you don't fully grasp the scope of its impact on you until you are in its absence. I think back to it might have been the first session with Daniel, but I remember I remember coming out and everything felt new. The world had this clearness that was so striking. And what's more surprising you will find is that the feeling will feel familiar because there was a point in your life where you didn't feel anxious. Oftentimes, when we were much younger before the trauma, before the fear, but I remember coming out onto the balcony the morning after and just being struck by how vivid and beautiful the world was.

And I look back, and I remember thinking and in hindsight, it must have always been there. The world must have surely always been this stunning. It's just now I could properly see it through Daniel's guidance, through his ability to, what I like to coin, remove the veil, because there's veils in in all of our lives. I think if you think deeply enough about it and keep an open mind, there's you can you can recognize that there's something obscuring your vision.

Oh, what else? I'm genuinely genuinely genuinely lot happier now. Yeah. And fuck, that's a good change.

### Career

I’ve had my sights set on this particular job for years but had never managed to land an interview. Within the span of two sessions I somehow landed this position that I had spent ages applying for without any luck prior to him. **I literally have my dream job now thanks to him.** 

Doing something I am passionate about and having a greater degree of responsibility for the first time in my career has given me such a sense of satisfaction or self-esteem as I continually strive to improve and become the best X I can be.

It’s the job position I’ve wanted since graduating from college. This is the happiest I've EVER been doing a job - and they are X hour shifts which while tiring at first now that I've adapted I've come to love the mellow but fast paced environment.

### Advice

One feeling that might surface is feeling so different internally that you almost feel like a different person. Even though I felt better and the changes were objectively better for me – I worried whether the people who hadn't seen me in a while would like (what felt like) this new version of me. I had effectively become secure in myself and that is such a radical change from someone who was chronically anxious.

That clingy attachment style just wasn’t as nearly prevalent as it used to be and it was startling to be so suddenly in its absence (which I think is a testament to how effective this therapy medium can be). It was concerning that this nearly life-or-death attachment I had to people in my life wasn’t there anymore. There was a part of me that still didn’t want to lose these people in my life I had come to cherish.

If I could offer any guidance ahead of time. Following a session you will have moments where you feel a little lost because your former way of operating and navigating through the world is in effect gone. It's a process of finding your footing again. The new path you are actively finding in this moment will be better and stronger. Remember that as you go through the process.

### Intimacy in Relationship / Partner

I've seen the strides in my own life are having a ripple effect on the people in my life. I suddenly see this change in my boyfriend as he's watched me start to thrive and just simply seeing me live my best life. I see him hanging out with his friends more (whereas before he wouldn’t be as outgoing), more motivated, taking better care of himself, etc. He’s starting to take charge of his own life. I'm so proud of him.

Intimacy with my partner improved **vastly**.
Primarily I am attributing to because the sexual shame that was inhibiting me from actually enjoying myself sexually.
Early on into our relationship intimacy with my boyfriend was awkward. It was my first time ever being sexual with someone and I had so much internalized shame I had no idea about.
I knew it was creating issues but struggled immensely to overcome it.

My boyfriend pointed this out to me recently unprompted - that usually he'd have to rally me to get me back on my feet again after something bad happens at work. But now it says if it's as if the thresholds were reset.
It's like he changed on a fundamental level that I know I can do this now. I can do anything I set my mind to now. Emotions have a way of interlacing us and everything we do. We can logically tell ourselves the thought that we can do it but it's different when the feeling is present versus it's absence. He gave me that emotion and stamped it in.

---

A more proactive disposition, period. All the positive changes that have been occurring in my life, I have seen had a ripple effect on the other people in my life, namely my partner. I think when I began to start shining a little bit, it had the effect of inspiring some changes in his own life. I've seen him begin living his life more compared to before. He was more dependant on me for interactions, and now I see him socializing more or hanging out with his friends and spending time with me too.

And I see him growing through these experiences. I've seen him begin to take more care of his appearance and take more initiative with his physical health, namely cutting down on soda and trying to cut on calories or not overeat as much so he can lose weight, and get that more shredded physique he's looking for because he's already a pretty big guy in terms of like, build and muscle. It's just been trimming down, and he also got a haircut, and he looks super sharp now. I see him exploring more hobbies, in part maybe because I've been exploring so many hobbies and been so open about sharing it with the people in my life, and maybe my passion or enthusiasm for them has been infectious.

It's a new feeling seeing the world so differently. It's somehow both disconcerting, knowing that this must have always been there and also a beautiful solace that you can't be this happy and that life can be peaceful and joyful and that any problem way can be tackled, that there is a solution. **It's not a figure of speech when he says that everything will feel and look new after going through sessions. Something about changing the way you process and think about the world. It covers everything, encompasses everything.**

And it's a beautiful, beautiful gift. One I'll always be indebted for and incredibly grateful. It's not a figure of speech when people describe to you or Daniel tells you that you will after coming out of sessions, the world will feel brand new. There's this sort of crispness and new quality to everything you look at, every facet of life because you're no longer burdened by the anxiety that was interlaced through literally every moment.

My boyfriend and I got in a little bit of a squabble tonight, and that was something on my mind I wanted to share. So one of our roommates has been going through a hard time now for a long time. He can't hold down a job basically for more than a month. Like, he's had jobs recently that have lasted literally a week, which is shocking to me at least. But yeah. And I see overlap in our experiences and stories. He's not trans, but he has chronically low self esteem and just does not, see the value in himself.

He constantly places his need or other people's needs above his own, and their ex he's openly said this to me. And, vice or the issue is that he's dealt with alcoholism and addiction and drug use for a number of years. Granted, he's he's come a long way. Like, the drug use isn't an issue anymore. And, he'll drink still, but now he's at the point where it'll be, like, once a week.

So he's come such a long way, but, like, the self destructive streak that I see him, perpetuate periodically is so profound and so damaging. But, I'm I'm getting away from the point at the moment. The point is, I basically, I advise, like, hey, like, hypnotherapy might be helpful for this issue. I think I've had a similar overlap in our experiences, and it to me, this was life changing, and I think it could be helpful as long as you're comfortable and open to it. I literally have absolute faith that this person can help you is what I said.

And, anyways, this how this segues to the squabble with my boyfriend is, he thought it was presumptuous of me to, say that to, say that to our roommate. Like, it would like, I was being dismissive towards his, like, feelings or struggles, like, perpetuating it like it could be that easy. **And, I mean, I can see his point, but also, like, I'm of the perspective now that it can be that easy**. It won't be without its hardship. It won't be without some effort, of course.

Like, the client has to be open and willing to doing, like, the work or just listening. Like, they can't like, if they're intentionally being, like, dense or stubborn with it, of course, it's not going to be effective. But, my point is my point is I really believe it can be that effective now, and I've said that with in good faith to my roommate slash friend because I wanted to help. But, anyways, my boyfriend just thought I was he didn't like it. He also kind of, he called it, like he he said he attributed something, of my some of my behaviours to toxic positivity.

Or he that's not the right expression. He said I was displaying toxic positivity, and that was a little bit I mean, oh, yeah. It hurt a little bit. Okay. Because I I know what toxic positivity looks like because I I feel like I've met a couple people in my life who have been like that, at least one person.

And I'm aware of it as a concept, And I I strive to look at things from different perceptions because that's so paramount in life, I feel like. And I don't know. I I don't see that I'm more optimistic than I used to be, and I think that's a good change. 

There were things I needed to learn from that conversation that were important because I'm not totally, not at fault. I need to listen. My boyfriend kinda post that I can be I need to open my I need to actually hear what my boyfriend is saying to me sometimes. I think sometimes I'm not allowing myself to actually feel what he's telling me. Like, I'm not quite envisioning what that would feel like.

I'm not quite putting myself in his shoes and actually grasping the concept, which is something you can actually do. I really feel like maybe not to the full experiential scope, but, certainly, you can get a sense just by projecting yourself into someone else in a sense. But, I have had an issue of not truly listening and hearing him out, and, that's not fair to him, and it's been a bit one-sided. I've displayed some behaviours of selfishness he's pointed out to me. Like, he's accommodated to some of my behaviours.

Or, well, I, I need to backtrack that. He's accommodated me a lot. I believe that's his perception that being a man, that's what he, like, should do for the woman. 

His points were basically listen deeply and sincerely, be more considerate of his needs and feelings and respectful of his time. Yeah. It's funny. Perception is so tricky.

What I mean by that is I believe this reality right now, but someone could say something to me that would make me believe another reality, almost maybe just as easily, between whether or not, like, I'm in the right or the wrong, you know? And I wanna be objective and grounded in the real world because that seems better. **I have struggled ... I have struggled for so long to be happy, and to finally be here is I don't even have the words for it**. It's I just I think back to all the struggle and all the moments. I get flashbacks to moments I've had in the past, and I remember how I felt then, but the memory is still there.

And it's an experience that can't adequately be captured in words. The way I would describe it if I had to attempt is either I've thoroughly been brainwashed consensually or Daniel removed all the cognitive distortions that I had, and it's kind of like seeing the world new newly again because you kind of well, it feels like you're seeing the beauty all around you, how vivid life is. You're also just thinking more clearly because the anxiety and depression will just it just objectively will distort influence and impact your life in ways that can't even be comprehended until the veil is lifted. Yeah.
 
### Validity

I had numerous people close to me in my life comment on how different I seemed in one way or another. Everyone was perceiving a change but what caught their eye was different each time. This was prior to me telling them anything about undergoing hypnotherapy. So this felt like an objective unit of measurement.

**I'm able to derive so much more joy in life now, there's not a constant cloud of anxiety obscuring it. Whether it's anxiety, depression, or some other mental health issue–it is hard to ACTUALLY conceptualize how much it is influencing your life until you are in its absence.**

**When the veil of it is lifted you will find that your whole world feels different. In a literal sense the world seems crisper, more beautiful, and full of potential because you are quite literally in the process of beginning to understand that you can live your life in ANY WAY that you want.** 

You begin to know and feel that you can do this - that you can do anything that you self-determine to do, because if THIS issue that has been plaguing you for YEARS can dissipate in a matter of a few sessions – then anything quite frankly feels possible. You are effectively unshackled.


### General Notes

It feels so natural and *important* to express these sentiments to others in life.

This isn't simply about saying nice things for the sake of it.

It's about conveying a *real* reality to someone because how will they know otherwise? 

Like you helped me in my life tremendously, Daniel. I don't know how apparent that is because you only see me in snapshots periodically.

But I WANT you to know that - because I need that to be understood. I can't tease out why yet but it's such a fundamental necessity and truth to me

I don't know what's all involved in acquiring a person like that but my impression is you naturally draw in people that would be receptive to that.

Your aura is naturally gravitating to people I really believe.

Like anyone I've shown your podcast to recently has immediately been enraptured by your Voice. 

Like literally I showed someone and they couldn't hold the conversation with me afterwards. They just kept coming back to talking about your podcast.

---

I actually **BELIEVE** I can do this now. Prior to meeting Daniel, my life had a constant pervading self-doubt overlaying it from years of lack of trust in my judgment. I think anyone who has had ADHD can relate to this experience in some way where you learn to associate your base impulses as bad through experiences growing up.

You have helped instil such a sense of confidence in me that I just simply lacked in a consistent way before. I will occasionally have flashbacks to moments in how I felt “before” doing the same task versus “now” and in those moments I realize how much I actually changed because there is a fundamental difference in how I am both feeling and conducting myself. I actually stand up for myself now. I have a sense of self-worth that I didn’t possess before. I was completely conflict adverse before and now I can actually do it which would’ve been incomprehensible to me prior to sessions … I **AM** different now - and instrumentally for the better.

---

So he just lives rent free in my head now - and surfaces randomly when I am in need of clarity or grounding. Whatever the right / intelligent choice is for myself moment-to-moment.

It's either literally his voice or the thought pattern emerges: “What would Daniel do in this situation and what would he advise?”

---

He **LITERALLY** changed the trajectory of my life and I will always feel so indebted and grateful to him for that. It’s hard to fathom the full scope of his impact because all the changes are happening simultaneously with each other and we are always limited by our perception. It can be difficult to see the big picture of our life because we exist in it moment-to-moment.

---

I've come to understand how terrifying it to is to exist in that
and that is in part why we create our structures and realities because the world becomes possible to navigate if 
There is this initial high
Then the following days
You can actually *feel* the processing happening.
 It puts me on the verge of tears to think about because in effect it feels like he *saved* me. and I will always be so incredibly grateful for that.
 The sense of relief there is feeling finally free is 
I existed in the eating disorder cycle for *YEARS*. A continual cycle of binging, starving, and exercise purging. I wanted to get better but each day I tried
it slowly chipped away any self worth and self esteem I had the continual fear
I didn't believe it was possible to escape
He changed that
When I met him I was still struggling with emotional eating stemming from a lack of selfcare and balance in life.

I was deadset on getting better once it became apparent this wasn't the "right" choice but I could not escape it
I cannot tell you how many times I struggled endlessly to break the cycle I was in. 

---

I was convinced it wasn’t possible for me to escape from the self sabotaging behaviours that seemed entwined into me. I knew I had made some distance from the self-destructive behaviours of my own accord, and that was enough to bolster me forward, but when the relapses did happen they tended to be incredibly devastating as I think anyone would feel if they had been trailed by them for years.

**My experience with hypnotherapy felt akin to knocking someone into orbit.** Prior to my sessions, I was stuck in the same repetitive cycle and struggling in nearly every facet of my life. The intrinsic lack of self-worth ensured I would always make things harder for myself. It felt like Daniel was the satellite that collided and knocked me into a proper orbit careening towards a happier life.

I genuinely feel like if Daniel didn’t intervene I would have been stuck in the same cycle for who knows how long. I could intuit I was trapped by something inside myself but couldn’t seem to break free no matter how hard I tried. No matter what new therapy medium or strategy I tried to employ.

This emotional catalyst will send you hurling towards a better life - a better you. It's startling how fast it can happen. 

---

He **made** me fully accept myself. I was somewhat aware that I struggled with self-love but not nearly the full scope of it until he healed the trauma. I couldn’t realize how vast the distortion of my perception of myself was until it wasn’t there anymore. He helped me see the beautiful qualities in me, as other people always see in us, but how we sometimes come to become blinded to them.

---

**It feels as if you erased my anxiety, which I just DO NOT comprehend how that could be possible,** after struggling with it for my entire life. I'll observe blips of anxiety surface but they almost automatically dissipate. I don’t understand how you can just turn a switch off to something. A test will be trying to tap into the pain afterwards and you will find you just “can’t”.

You can’t feel that bad ever again and I can’t tell you how much of a relief that is.

---

I've been noticing how my life has just become easier overall now. It's a bit of a surreal feeling because what happened was so intangible. I didn't realize how physically and mentally depleting constantly being in a state of self-doubt could be until I was in the absence of it.

Life is easier in so many facets because I'm no longer weighed down by the constant burden that is anxiety. I still can't totally wrap my mind around HOW he did it, but now that there's not this constant sense of self-doubt everything is just *easier* to navigate.

---

I have struggled for so long to be happy. And to finally be here is I don't even have the words for it. It's just - I think back to all the struggle and all the moments. I get flashbacks to moments I've had in the past and I remember how I felt then. It’s distant, but the memory is still there. And it's an experience that can't adequately be captured in words.

The way I would describe it if I had to attempt is either I've thoroughly been brainwashed in a positive or consensual way (I was a fan of being brainwashed before I met Daniel) or Daniel removed all the cognitive distortions that I had, and it's kind of like seeing the world newly again because you in effect **ARE**. It feels like you're seeing the beauty all around you, how vivid life is, and it’s stunning.

You're also just thinking more clearly because the anxiety and depression will just objectively distort, influence, and impact your life in ways that can't even be comprehended until the veil is lifted.

---

**Daniel changed my life in ways that are still incomprehensible to me.** 

**I didn't know life could be this vivid and beautiful. That might sound hyperbolic at first but it is a bona fide reality for me. You just don't realize how much trauma can obscure your vision of the world until it is lifted from you.**

**Once the veil of the trauma you've experienced is lifted you start to see how much there really is.**

**This emotional clarity will do SO much for your life. I cannot stress that enough. It's akin to someone lighting your spirit ablaze because you will not only feel free but actually are free. This sudden deep understanding that you are no longer shackled - that you are quite literally limitless in a way, is a euphoric feeling. It will create a momentum that builds onto itself. Sending a cascade ripple effect through your life. Until one day you realize you’ve become an amazing version of yourself.**

---

There's just a calm implicit certainty that wasn't there before knowing that I can navigate anything that comes my way. It is such a different feeling looking in the mirror and being able to feel that way.

I periodically find myself wondering if this is what it feels like to be 'normal'? It's just I didn't realize distortions until they were pulled from me. There's a level of PRESENTNESS that comes from it. It is a beginning to the connection to the self.

Sometimes he feels a bit like a prophet to me because of how his ‘Suggestions’ always come to fruition. He has worked hard to to eliminate confirmation bias in the equation and it seems like he has such a deep insight into these issues that he can accurately predict your outcome. I think this is a real quality that can be achieved when someone hones themselves to an unparalleled extent (which becomes apparent anytime you listen to him speak). He's just put the work in.

---

He helped me to learn to express myself naturally by listening to my Unconscious Mind and it has helped connecting with people just being myself.

---

If you think about your life - I am sure there are moments where you have observed yourself repeating behaviours; maybe ones you would rather do without. Whether that's an eating disorder, drawn to the wrong relationships, etc. 

---

I'm changing at such a rapid pace that it's hard to fathom the extent. But it's something you can perceive internally. A sense. Emotions from years and years buried unravelling and becoming clear in what they are. Freeing me up to lead my life now in the present. I didn't know you could feel this way.

Is this what it's like to finally be free? I could intuit FOR YEARS I was trapped; limited by something. I knew it was from within. An internal sense.

I could observe in certain others that they seemed somehow more clear internally. More free. And now to finally have that feeling is somehow both cathartic and incomprehensible. It's akin to…

---

**What I don't think is commonly understood about perception is that when you exist within a certain frame of mind for a long enough period of time - you begin to forget that you could feel any other way. For example, if you deal with chronic latent anxiety as I did at a certain point that becomes your new baseline normal.** No one is born innately feeling it but rather they become us / get put into us through experiences we have. They tend to be so sweeping, these emotions can be put into us so suddenly and experiences often come on suddenly and are brought onto us (as no one is born innately feeling this way). You learn to function. You find ways to cope. But time blurs so you forget that that you could feel any other way. It effectively becomes your baseline.  

---

I was sceptical of hypnosis going in mostly because I couldn't understand *how* it worked but as the sessions went on it became increasingly impossible to deny. Post-hypnotic suggestions given to me kept coming to fruition. **Things I had struggled with for *YEARS* suddenly had way less pull to them.** I wrestled with lingering episodes of emotional eating from my previous time in an eating disorder. After sessions with him I kept finding that while the temptation to engage in disordered eating behaviors would surface I just simply couldn't bring myself to actually follow through with the act --- something deeper inside myself would stop me. I genuinely couldn't override the impulse. What had become comfortable on a deep internal level had shifted. 
They had become uncompelling. 

---

I can't even wrap my mind around how much he changed me.
As I look back at my calendar notes prior to our sessions - and over the course of time since. 
I see a radical difference
I went from getting caught up in things that don't matter to being way more organized efficient and just CLEAR.
I saw it go from unorganized and cluttered to streamline and effective.

---

Literally I can just make the responsible decision now. I can actually take care of myself.

---

Okay, so I **USED** think I was broken - genuinely believed it.

It is disconcerting sometimes going through this process because it *will* shake you perception of reality. It is something you can't full understand until you go through it. The best way I can describe it is - you exist within a certain reality. The matrix of your mind. It's/You are always growing and changing but it is so habitual that you cannot see.

Daniel is so utterly right about everything that it's stunning and humbling to realize and see first hand. I didn't realize what the intelligent decision was until he showed me how to love myself.

---

I, it's just stunning to me sometimes. I mean, I look around me and I just feel more alive than I used to. Everything has more breath to it. There's more color to the strokes of life.

And I see more clearly now, genuinely, because one of the things that it's hard to recognize when you're in an anxious state of mind is how much it's actually clouding your judgment. Because, like I said, the fear will interlace every aspect of your life. And it's only until you're in its absence that you can real realize and properly see that. Being able to see clearly has been such a good change. It allows you to make, or it's enabled me to make the happier and calmer now, happier and calmer now because there's just not this chronic fear surfacing every single day.

You can find so much joy in the little moments. And I'm so grateful for that. So thank you, Daniel. Like, fuck. It's still hard for me to, like, wrap my mind around what you did to me.

It's not a bad change, sincerely, but it is earth shaking. And it's like and I have a feeling that'd be the case for anyone. You live your life for so long and you have an I certain identity and a certain set of beliefs, and then, And I don't wanna say lose it, but but to relinquish it and let it go, you you start to second question your reality and everyone else's reality because you become more aware. You become aware of something, the undercurrent, ruling all of our lives or guiding all of our lives, the undercurrent guiding all of our lives in a subtle, seamless way. 

Daniel has this natural knack to take, to break down concepts in your head into a way that's easily understood.

I cannot lie to myself now, and I have Daniel to thank for that. Period.

He has this natural skill to be able to reveal the lies we tell ourselves, which might sound crazy to someone upon hearing that or condescending, but it's so utterly true. So maybe I need to talk about myself. Okay. Literally a couple weeks ago when he told me that all he wanted for me to do was to love myself as much as I love others and to always do what's in my long term good. For the former thought, I had no idea where to even begin with that.

When he first told me to love myself as much as I love others, I couldn't even fathom how. Like, I could kind of infer what he was getting at, but I couldn't. But it was, like, such a stretch in my imagination.

It also makes you aware of the distortions inside of yourself. I so I guess maybe I'll cycle back. I literally cannot lie to myself now, and that is such a good thing. Daniel has this natural talent to be able to, take the words out of take the concepts out of your head and be able to put them into words. And in doing so, he helps you immediately process and understand what's been inside you this whole time.

So in my case, he made me aware of, what was it, in the podcast? Something like the distortions or the lies we tell ourselves in the moment.

---

Before, I lived in a constant sense of self doubt.

It interfaced every aspect of my life. I could never make any effective decision because I was always second guessing whatever decision I made to. There was no right answers, thus I couldn't decide. It was, in effect, analysis paralysis times a thousand because it was every day, I couldn't even speak to people properly because I was so caught up with knowing what the right thing to say was or how I didn't even know how to express myself authentically. That was one thing Daniel did for me too.

He helped me be learn how to be way more honest with myself, with others. Even if it's not perfect, he helped me understand that I don't need to be perfect. I just need to try and strive to perfection. I strive to be the best version of myself at the very least because there's always room for improvement, especially if you just keep your eye open to it. I think so many times people, well, I guess I made was made a parent of it, but I didn't realize how frequently I stopped myself from progressing or growing in life because I was just afraid of failure or fear of failure, and so I wouldn't do it.

I would just push it off, but I was blind to it even because you rationalize and convince to yourself these things so convincingly that you don't recognize it. I've if there's one thing I wish more people could realize, it's the it's how much perception matters and how distorted your beliefs or perceptions can be. You you just cannot see it. It seems like you cannot see it until you're from a different point of view, and then it becomes infinitely more apparent. But there are like, we tell ourselves lies every day, like, and I think there's such a power to being aware of these mechanisms.

But let's cycle back to Daniel. What can I say about Daniel? He's enchanting. I think anyone who listens to him is immediately enamoured, if not intrigued, by him because, one, his voice is effectively liquid silk, liquid gold, like butter, as smooth as butter. Oh my god.

And two, he's incredibly compassionate and caring. He genuinely makes you feel so understood, in part because I think he actually understands. To make someone feel seen and heard, it requires a degree of actual understanding on the issue, and Daniel's just that person. It becomes I mean, talking with him within the first couple minutes, it becomes apparent that he is extremely well versed and thorough and knowledgeable and so incredibly skilled and talented, especially with his voice and his words.

I think it's very fitting he's called the Wordsmith because he combines two aspects of that. I think a Smith implies strength, and the Wordsmith is someone who creates ideas and perceptions with their words. So maybe if I'm trying to rehash it or recap it, I think the title, the Wordsmith, is incredibly fitting for Daniel. He is literally the blacksmith forge that welds words out of thin air and creates perceptions.

He is like a battering ram, he will literally shatter your perception of the world in the best possible way. I know that probably I know that might sound scary, but I promise you it's the best thing that's ever happened to me. I'm still in the process and learning every day as I grow into my best self, but now it's actually possible. Before, it just wasn't, and I think that's where a lot of the anxiety was coming from because on some innate level, I knew I was trapped inside myself, and now I no longer feel like that. 

Now I know I can just do it.

I can just live my life however I want within reason while still being respectful to others, of course. But there's nothing stopping me from going where I want to go, going where my heart wants to go, and just be happy. That's crazy to me sometimes. 

 I have never met someone so caring that can make you feel so like, everything will be okay. And not only are they making you feel like everything will be okay, but he's making you understand that everything will be okay because you are capable of being okay. You know how to.

You can just innately and intuitively do it. Sometimes just with a little bit of help.
