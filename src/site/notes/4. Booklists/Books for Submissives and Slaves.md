#### Highly Influential Erotic Fiction

- [The Marketplace Series](https://amzn.to/2TDngqT) by Laura Antoniou

Within the world of erotic fiction, there are a handful of titles mentioned over and over for their influence on the genre and their historical potency. These books have created entire subcultures, and shaped the expressions of desire of happy, healthy kink folk the world over.

In the spirit of education, the most well known and seminal titles are listed above. I suggest that you read any of these books that appeal to you, and if you find a deep love of one or more, that it can provide clues to the overall direction of your explorations deeper into your wants and desires, where you feel most at home. Enjoy!
 
Much of this content will mirror the Dominants list, as being a Dominant requires a broad and deep knowledge, while a Submissives knowledge is often a subset of that, combined with a lot of training on how their particular Owner likes things done. 

As a Submissive, your purpose in life is to serve, be useful and be pleasing to your Dominant. However, the more skills you can bring to the relationship, the more valuable you will be, the higher quality Dominant partner you can attract and these books cover the real fundamentals and basics of being a useful Submissive.

The two books on the Required List are non-negotiable, they will teach you how to take care of yourself, set boundaries, and be a healthy and pleasing submissive, as well as how to truly serve and be at peace with your service in a meaningful way.

The path of a Submissive is sometimes hard, and often joyful. You are special, you are chosen, and whom you choose to serve gives your life tremendous meaning and importance. You have so much to contribute, and you will find the place where you belong.

I believe in you. I truly do.

#### Required Books

These are ESSENTIAL for every submissive and every relationship. I will universally prescribe reading these for both Doms and Subs, and Doms will commonly recommend these books to potential Subs.

Elizabeth Cramer is excellent, and I recommend all of her books as being worthwhile.
