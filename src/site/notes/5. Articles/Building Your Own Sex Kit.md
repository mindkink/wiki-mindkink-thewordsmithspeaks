**The Short Version**

**TLDR:** It's a guide on how to build a "pick up and go out to fuck" bag to suit yourself and your interests.

**The Longer Version**

A truly useful idea, a Sex Kit is a bag that comes preloaded for a sexual occasion, so that you can just pick it up and head out on a date, to meet up in a hotel room and fuck, or a weekend away with a girl training her into the perfect version of herself. I mostly use mine for training weekends and trips to hotels to break in new girls, and have refined the concept to a sharp edge. I'll share how I've found to be the best way to implement it here.

As always - take what works for you, discard what does not, and add what is uniquely your own.

How I do it is that I have a cheap (but expensive looking) overnight bag that I picked up for $4 from a second hand store, and a general list of standard contents along with some consumables (like lube, condoms, toy cleaner and those little disposable shampoo / bodywash bottles that you get from hotels in case the place you're going to is an AirBnB and doesn't have any). My bag has three compartments, for simplicities sake I keep the tools of my trade in one section, the consumables in a side pocket, and my pyjamas, a change of clothes and the unique written down training plan / my notes of the evening in the third pocket.

My bag sits in my wardrobe, and is always ready to pick up, load up with a Bathroom Kit of my electric toothbrush, shaving kit, beard care gear (I keep these things in my bathroom as I use them daily) and then roll out with.

I also have a **Backup Box** which is a Converse shoe-box in my wardrobe where I have extra, less commonly used tools, extra consumables, and a few other bits and pieces.

Having a bag ready to go (or only needing the addition of a few personal items like a toothbrush, toothpaste, etc. means that you can just pick it up and go, it's one less thing to worry about and by "fixing" those variables you can pay more attention to things like the overall plan, the unique circumstances of the date and the actual training.

And you know, relaxing into intimacy with them, creating a deep connection and playing hard, fast and fun. See the bottom of this page for a shopping list with some links.

**The Essentials**

My current Sex Kit has gone through a few iterations, this is what I use right now:

**Making yours Better for You**

Start with this as a template, and modify to suit yourself. **If you're a rope guy**, add a heap more rope and drop the stuff you aren't going to use often. **If you're into impact play**, add some crops, some more canes or bats. You can store those in those cardboard tubes they sell for rolling up posters and mailing them, which you can buy from Australia Post.

I seal anything likely to leak (lubricant, massage oil in a container, etc) in a ziplocked sandwich bag for extra security.

**Keep it Lean and Sharp**

Keep your loadout lean. I still occasionally run a scene with only a single implement, as a challenge to myself to explore all the different ways that it can be used. I once did a several-continuous-hour full body flogging scene with only a single flogger, it taught me a lot about how to be flexible with a single tool. Challenge yourself and keep your general loadout to just what you really need to get your thing going, you know what you like and what you are good at. Have some fucking faith in yourself.
