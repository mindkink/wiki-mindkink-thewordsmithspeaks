### Intention

Provide clear advice on how to use fake Pills and fake Injections to engage in intense hypnokink scenes incorporating believable medical elements (usually for Brainwashing purposes).

### Tools

Placebo Pills - Multicoloured pills which literally do nothing. Can be modified with hypnosis to have any desired effect.

Injectable Vitamin B12 - Used as a safe, easy to obtain way to inject a coloured substance into the body with no known side effects when used correctly and with minimal dosages.

### Safety

When injecting ANYTHING into the body always follow common sense and medical advice. DO NOT INJECT ANYTHING UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING, AND HOW TO HANDLE IT IF IT GOES WRONG.

### Obtaining Materials

#### Pills

Search for "placebo pills" online. They should have NO ACTIVE INGREDIENTS and should not contain Lactose (as some people are allergic) go for ones with Sucrose instead.

Go to any Pharmacy and look for Homeopathic Remedies in the form of pills. They should contain NO ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.

#### Injectables

Go to a Pharmacy or order online, Amazon usually has what you need or the website of any reputable pharmacy will as well.

You are going to use Insulin Syringes and Liquid Vitamin B12

Go to any pharmacy and ask for the following, exactly.

"I want Vitamin B12 injections"

"I want at least five 1 millilitre Insulin Syringes". They will usually sell them either individually, or in lots of ten. Relax. It is legal to buy these things and you do not need a prescription.

## Actually Doing It

### Pills

Materials Required: The actual pills.

Literally give them the pill to take, within the framework of the scene. Describe to them the effects before they take it. Or don't. Then when they respond in any way at all, capture and utilise that response to create your desired effect.

### Injections

I'm going to put this here in all caps.

ONLY DO THIS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING CONTACT ME AND I WILL WALK YOU THROUGH IT.

Materials Required: Alcohol Wipes, Insulin Syringes, Vial or Bottle of B12, Sterile Gloves

You are going to go into the deltoid / shoulder. You are going to use an Insulin Syringe, with a tiny and painless needle. 

Follow the procedure above but when drawing in, USE ONLY A TINY AMOUNT OF B12. For example, a standard dosage is 1 ml. You will use literally less than 1 / 20 th of that. Literally the tiniest amount. Ensure there are no air bubbles in the syringe, and follow safe injecting procedure. Ensure that you KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING before you inject someone.
