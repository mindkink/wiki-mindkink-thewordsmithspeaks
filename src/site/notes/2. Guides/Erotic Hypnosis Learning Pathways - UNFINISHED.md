Hypnosis in it's entirety is a complex skillset, and for that reason not all of it's different facets (Erotic, Therapeutic, Stage, Comedy, etc) need to be grasped before you actually start practising with a partner, merely the fundamentals. The basic skills of a successful and effective Hypnosis Session include how to establish authority, how to set up a session, establish boundaries, negotiate content, induce trance, deliver on the experience, handle any negative reactions, and emerge with positive suggestions. Adding extra techniques from the Erotic or Therapeutic fields (if have been appropriately trained by a qualified professional) can come after a solid basis of experience has been established. For that, any one of the books below in the Introductory Texts will do, there is no need to read all of them as there is a significant overlap in content covered.

**A Note of Caution:** Some of these Therapeutic based techniques are significantly more powerful than simple direct suggestion and can result in changes that are difficult to undo. Always consider the end goal, the capabilities and desires of yourself and your subject, and your technical abilities and moral character when going deeper into longer term change. 

Most of these books teach or explain Hypnosis in the context of Hypnotherapy, which is not appropriate for use with your intimate partners, so take the techniques you like â€“ but understand the context and refer to the notes above. **Unless it is explicitly desired and consensually agreed to prior to a session, all effects should end at the conclusion of the session.**

My solid advice to you is to always learn how to UNDO an effect, before you learn how to apply it - and to only apply effects that you personally know how to undo. If you get stuck and need a hand - contact me for advice using the contact page.

**Learning Hypnosis from books is NOT how I recommend you find or build the main body of your skills**, instead I STRONGLY suggest you look at the website above and find one of the several free, recorded classes there where I describe the process in detail using a variety of resources, with clear benchmarks for success and progression and a detailed discussion of traps and pitfalls, supplementary and complementary skillsets (such as Massage, NLP, and others) and provide a community and further resources to guide your progression and growth of skills.

**If you would like to learn General Hypnosis, I would strongly recommend the following two resources:**

- https://hypnosistrainingacademy.com/ - Everything by Igor Ledowchowski
- https://mikemandelhypnosis.com/ - Everything by Mike Mandel



**Further General Hypnosis Educational Resources**

**A Free Introductory Audio Program on Hypnosis - "Hypnosis Exposed"**

[Get the audio lectures here](https://hypnosistrainingacademy.com/free/gift/foryou/) - A free set of three audio lectures, explaining to the complete beginner what Trance and Hypnosis is, and how to create it.

**Learning General Hypnosis - The HLSS Cards**

[Get these Cards](https://hypnosistrainingacademy.com/hypnotic-language-shortcut-system) - They are free ($6 for shipping) and they come with a series of videos on their use. They are the single most effective tool I have found for creating and teaching effective hypnotists, and this includes erotic hypnotists. (Though the cards themselves are not erotic in nature, it's very simple to layer in erotic content when you practice). **Buy them, use them**. You will have to click through a few pages of marketing fluff on the website to get to the purchase page, just scroll down and move forward. They are worth it.




Learning Erotic Hypnosis is **easy, fun and safe** - you read the right books in the right order, practice frequently with a partner you trust, learn to go into trance yourself so you know what it feels like, and avoid the pitfall of too much reading and theory, and not enough action and practice. Within 3 months, you can go from know-nothing beginner to accomplished intermediate.

**I did a whole Podcast specifically on Learning Erotic Hypnosis, check that out for more details and a full learning pathway.**

When it comes to learning, reading one book properly is worth a thousand disjointed tumblr posts.

**The most important thing**

The most important thing to remember is this: **Erotic Hypnosis is just a subset of ordinary Hypnosis Techniques with some sexy content thrown in** - the same techniques still apply (Erotic Hypnosis can be considered a subset of a broader category of "Hypnosis" of which Stage and Therapeutic work are also subsets). Learning general hypnosis will make you a better erotic hypnotist - once that solid,practised hypnotic technique is combined with some awesome, sexy content. Take inspiration from everywhere - I myself have taken inspiration for some of my best Scenes from Nanotechnology, the physics of how stars form and function, the growth of plants, how to knit, Harry Potter (Imperius Curse anyone?), the TV show Tru Blood (Vampirism and being drained of will and strength, compulsion, ownership and hierarchy - this show is a gold mine), Pharmacology, books, movies, broader or famous scenes in media. You can use anything you and your partner enjoy to take both of you on a journey of fun, domination, sexy awakening, or just plain old brainwashing.

Below you will find a fairly comprehensive list of hypnosis and erotic hypnosis specific textbooks and written resources, the result of many years of my own reading, study and research. For further content on the subject of Erotic Hypnosis check out the resources page for some good EH podcasts, websites and other useful software, educational resources, etc. Mark Cunninghams Essential Renegade Hypnosis is good but definitely not for people without a strong foundational skillset and a developed sense of ethics.




**Further Erotic Hypnosis Educational Resources**

**The Essential Renegade Hypnosis by Mark Cunningham**

[Purchase it here](https://renegadehypnotist.com/essentialrenegadehypnosis/). An Intermediate-level video and audio course of study detailing a proven process to use erotic hypnosis to create more empowered and more sensual women and men. Ignore marketing page, this stuff works, it works incredibly well, and its a core part of my relationships. He's an excellent Hypnotist but his stuff will be completely incomprehensible unless you already know how the pieces work, so study other stuff first then come to this later. He's a pioneer and trailblazer in this field, an all around great guy and is actively developing some cutting edge stuff.

# Learn Erotic Hypnosis

I have a complete and **free** (no strings attached) audio program on using Erotic Hypnosis and Operant Conditioning to help create a healthy, fulfilling relationship. It's 2+ hours of audio and several printable templates that you can instantly use to begin training your partner.

[You can download it here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17Si5PPaPKDdZNh-XOcQQcEa7t6ku-Pbk?usp=sharing)

I've taught over a dozen in-person classes, published over 65,000+ words, and written two books. The following process is the one I would follow if I were a complete beginner, starting from scratch who wanted to learn erotic hypnosis simply, easily and with a minimum of fuss. If you want personalised tuition, [email me here](https://mindkink.net/contact/) and set up a conversation.

First - **take your learning seriously**. Find others who also wish to seriously learn, disregard and ignore those who are not as committed as you. These skills are easy to learn. The format is the same as non-erotic hypnosis, just without the sexual content or intent. Form groups and small, local communities and practice and discuss frequently amongst each other. Setting up a group chat in [Signal](https://signal.org/download/) (_preferred_) or [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) is an excellent idea.

**The Process**

1.  [Go here and get these.](https://hypnosistrainingacademy.com/free/gift/foryou/) Listen to the first one through 3 times, then the other two at least once.
    
2.  Buy these cards and watch the training videos. [Get them here](https://hypnosistrainingacademy.com/hypnotic-language-shortcut-system/). Watch every instructional video at least 3 times, and spend a minimum of 3 full hours practising by yourself or with a solid, reliable partner. **The Standard** - You can move on when you can pick a theme, and spin at least 6 power words into a flow for at least 5 solid minutes, smoothly and naturally with minimal warm up.
    
3.  Spend at least an additional 30 minutes over multiple practice sessions doing the previous step, but adding "emotion" and "intent" into your voice. Picture your voice "bathing" the other person and moving up and down their body as they respond.
    
4.  Mark Cunningham has an excellent introductory program to Erotic Hypnosis, focussing on simple skills and a single induction, and bridging to building responsiveness and creating triggers, desired effects, clearing negativity and then advancing forward. You can [buy it here](https://renegadehypnotist.com/power-of-erotic-hypnosis/) and I highly recommend it. Just ignore the marketing-speak and skip straight to the bottom. His stuff is solid and its worth the investment. Study hard and master the content through practice.
    
5.  By now you are ready to start doing it "for realsies" with a partner and combining hypnosis and physical sex. Give suggestions for emptying their mind of thought, having them focus on your pleasure or on their pleasure, feeling proud of themselves, and feeling amazing. Take it slowly, discuss extensively before doing hypnosis, and debrief afterwards. Anton Fulmen has an excellent section in his book The Heart of Dominance that covers negotiating a scene. [Buy his book](https://amzn.to/2x9Hi3F). In a nutshell it's 7 Questions -- _What do we want? What are our risks? What are our relevant limits and likely triggers? How will it start and how will it end? How will we maintain communication during? Who else will be involved and how? What happens after?_ I personally use these every time.
    
6.  Join a practice group -- that is, a group set up specifically to practise hypnosis. You can find plenty listed on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/), (just search for "hypnosis", "recreational hypnosis" or "erotic hypnosis" or start your own. It's easy, and you already have everything you need to begin practicing. Just skip the erotic stuff with people you aren't sleeping with for now and focus on general skills and themes like "becoming a more confident hypnotist" and "relaxation", etc.
    
7.  Buy a copy of the [Mind Play Study Guide](https://amzn.to/39NCTRg). This will give you everything you need to fuel a practice group and broaden your repertoire of technique. **The Standard** - Practice until you can do any three inductions easily, off the bat with no notes, and until you can create and collapse simple triggers, and give post hypnotic suggestions. Build your confidence and your skillbase, then advance.
    
8.  At this point, you can chart your own course. Common options for your next steps:
    
9.  Go deeper into Erotic Hypnosis with [Mark Cunninghams Essential Rengade Hypnosis Curriculum](https://renegadehypnotist.com/essentialrenegadehypnosis/). Again, ignore marketing-speak and skip straight to the end.
    
10.  Produce your own Hypnosis Recordings or record sessions you do with your subjects for your pleasure and theirs.
    
11.  Begin learning how to Train and Condition others.
    
12.  Read any of the Optional Books on Erotic Hypnosis or General Hypnosis in the Reading Lists on this site.
