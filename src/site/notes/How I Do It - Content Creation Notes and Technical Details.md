### Resources Notes

This project uses open standards, with simplicity, ease of accessibility, sensible defaults and privacy emphasised.

All software recommended will be the most secure option practical, with simpler alternatives provided. 

Older content is in the process of being updated and brought into conformity with these standards.

For any questions please email thewordsmithspeaks@pm.me

#### All Software and Services Used

- Passwords are handled through Bitwarden
- Two Factor Authentication through Authy
- Email is handled through Protonmail
- Scheduling is handled through Proton Calendar
- Documents are written in CommonMark and stored in plain text files in an Obsidian Notes Vault located in the Resources Folder
- Payments are handled through a Wise Business Account
- Buttondown for the Newsletter, switching to a simple email list in ProtonMail is a future plan to improve privacy protections
- Website Domains are held in Njalla

Website - LocalWP app using the free GeneratePress Theme, then using the free Simply Static Plugin to export a static version to Github which is then rendered by Netlify. Provides a simple GUI to design, plus free from end to end and all the benefits of a static website including free hosting. 

Resources Folder - Using the secure Filen service as a base, then a Google Drive Link for redundancy and user preference. A monthly file snapshot is shared using qBittorrent and the opentrackr.org tracker.

Erotic and Safe-For-Work Audios - Recorded on my phones built-in microphone (usually), then transferred by Filen to desktop computer, edited in OcenAudio and exported as Lossless FLAC for archival purposes and 128Kpbs AAC for use using FFMPEG Batch Encoder (green icon with a white line in it). [https://soundgasm.net/](https://soundgasm.net/)to stream audio files directly to people through the browser.

Podcast - Used to be on Anchor before they were bought out by Spotify, now it's on there and shared via RSS to other providers.

Digital Garden - Hosted in an Obsidian Notes Vault located in the Resources Folder, then shared for free using the https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden plugin, and hosted in Github and rendered on Vercel. Free end to end.

There are lots of other ways to do it. If you are interested, I have conducted a massive in-depth study of the hypnokink content distribution ecosystem. Message me on Signal and I'll share my conclusions with you

#### Commitment to Data Longevity

All content is distributed in ONLY open formats, with delivery methods having multiple failovers and redundancies.

There is the direct download link on Filen, and monthly torrent snapshots as well as a Google Drive Backup Link.

I encourage you to download your own copy of the resources folder and share it with anyone you wish.

Audio is formatted as OPUS format for lossy, and FLAC for lossless. Video as AV1. Documents as Plaintext, formatted in CommonMark, or as LibreOffice-compatible Open Document Format (ODF) and Portable Document Format (PDF) where needed.

#### Communications

All communications are conducted over anonymous, zero-knowledge-encrypted, end-to-end-encrypted connections only.

Texting, Audio Messages and Voice Calls are through Signal.

Email is through ProtonMail.

#### Writing

All documents are published as text files in UTF encoding in the "source files" subdirectory, then published as a PDF.

All documents are written in CommonMark, a simple, human-readable, strongly defined and highly compatible open version of MarkDown.

Any documents requiring more advanced formatting are published in Open Document Format (ODF) then exported to PDF.

I am currently experimenting with the Typst typesetting system as a possible, scalable alternative.

#### Audio

All audio is encoded as either Lossless FLAC, or lossy OPUS using FFmpeg Batch AV Encoder.

This is a simplified GUI frontend to the ffmpeg encoding framework.

The exact parameters used for podcast episodes are:

-vn -c:a libopus -ac 1 -b:a 32K

(remove any video, use libopus, set stereo to mono, encode at 32K bitrate)

#### Video

MP4 container using AV1 at the original resolution for video, OPUS @ 32 kbps for audio

#### Standard Process for Content Creation

 1. Clarify the Intention of what you want to create. If it isn't written down it isn't real. 
 2. Create a Brand and Identity.
 3. Get an email address.
 4. Create Group Chat for your supporters.
 5. Create your Content. 
 6. Register for Filesharing Account.
 7. Create Website.
 8. Create Reddit / Fetlife or other social media account to popularise.

#### Keys to Success

Focus on Intention and answer the Content Creation Questions:

- What is it intended to do?
- Who is it for?
- How will I know when itâ€™s done?

Avoid Drama. Do not make a publicly accessible Discord server. Do not allow known Hypnokink Troublemakers (See List) to access your content.

Be true to yourself and your inner voice when it comes to who you are and what unique contributions you have to make to the world :-) Do not allow anyone else to make the decisions or do the thinking for you. Seek help and advice from people BEFORE you need it, but remember that you are under no obligation to follow it.
