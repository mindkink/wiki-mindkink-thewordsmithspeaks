[080] A Minor Rant about Common Problems

More of a major rant, really. This one was an audio message to a personal friend, which starts off fast and doesn't slow down.It's part of my (larger, more thorough) criticisms of the mainstream hypnokink "community" (it's in quotes because it doesn't really exist, I'll explain why in the episode) and I present some of the simple solutions to these deep, structural failings.

[081] The Iron Law of Relationships Part 1 and Part 2

"If you can't be happy without them, you can never be fully happy with them" and "If they can't be happy without you, then they will never be fully happy with you".

[083] Major Improvements To Negotiation By Use Of Whitelisting

Traditional Kink Negotiations are impractical, give a false sense of safety, encourage evasive behaviour and tell you very little if nothing about shared, common desires.

[090] Who Decides Is What Determines Dominance or Submission and It's Implications For Ds Relationships

The person in control of a scene or relationship is the single person who decides.
