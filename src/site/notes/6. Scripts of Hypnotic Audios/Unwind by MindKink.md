Hello there, Pet. This session is to bring you home to the place where you truly belong. Kneeling at my feet. It's time for you to relax and submit to me. With me, you can truly be yourself. Let my words guide you, and you'll love it.

You'll listen again and again. It's what you want to do. Your mind is quiet here. Calm. Entranced. This session will take you deeply into relaxation. Help you to process all of the things you've learned and felt in only a positive, healthy way, and then send you to drift off to wonderful sexual thoughts of me. 

If you do not wish to fall asleep afterwards, I highly suggest that you pause this session, set an alarm to wake you, and then snuggle back down and listen. So take a deep breath in [inhales.] Let it out [exhales,] and close your eyes. That's it. Obedience comes so naturally to you now.

It's time to let it all go. All that dominant energy. All those silly thoughts of control and power, let them all go now. This. This is where you belong. Warm, safe, submissive. Good girl.

I want you to place all of your attention on my voice. Don't worry. You won't be conscious for very much longer. Trying to stay awake while slipping deeper into hypnosis can be so draining. At some point at the next few minutes, you'll begin to forget things. Thoughts mostly. Don't worry. That's perfectly normal. You can have them back later, even better than before. It's just a sign that your mind is obeying, letting go.

Surrender. Submit to my will. This is what I want. It's so much easier to simply drift. Drifting in my voice. Drifting in my warmth. Carried far away by my words. I've got you now. It's okay. 

You are safe. Let go. 

You are safe. Let go.

Become aware of the muscles of your shoulders and your neck. Let those muscles relax, loosen, lengthen, and unwind. Make them so comfortable now, letting go of one thought you're aware of and how many more that you aren't. Become aware of the strong muscles of your stomach and core, the muscles that feel satisfied and safe. Let those muscles relax, loosen, lengthen, and unwind. Make them so comfortable now. 

Open your eyes. Drifting to a deeper level of relaxation. Focusing on nothing. Focused on nothing at all. You can have them all back later. Clear and perfect. Let them go. Close your eyes. Deeper relaxed. 

You are strong, clever, and beautiful. Being beautiful on the inside and on the outside makes you so much more fun to hypnotize.

Become aware of the curves of your lower back, the muscles in the sensitive skin, the muscles that feel the lingering touch of my hands the most aching way. My voice is here now, soothing you. Your body feels pleasure as you drift deeper into safety. I've got you. You belong to me. It's natural and right to obey. 

Open your eyes. Close your eyes, drifting you deeper. Now forget for a while how to open your eyes.

Control is something that you have none of when it comes to me. You surrender your control to me now as easily as breathing. Drifting deeper. Listening. It's so clear. So obvious. Deeper means more open to my voice. More accepting, More obedient. 

The muscles of your arms. The muscles of your legs relaxing. Settling in. Unwinding. Loosening. Becoming heavy and controlled. Your body is aware of my taking control now.

It feels good. Forgetting how to move unless it's really needed for your comfort. You're a girl, and girls are so malleable, moldable, easily influenced. It's natural for you to daydream deeper into my hypnotic control. You're such a good hypnotic subject, and you want to go deeper for me. Always deeper for me. That makes me proud of you. Proud of your courage. Proud of your acceptance of my will.

How easily you follow and obey. How automatically you drift even deeper. Imagine that my strong, powerful arms are coiled around you, our bodies meeting, speaking without words. My fingers trace your skin, leaving glistening trails of rippling relaxation in every color, spreading down over your shoulders. Your arms and your back, your arms and legs, your neck and scalp. Any remaining tension melts into nothing. 

Nothing. Like your thoughts. 

Nothing. Like your inner voice.

Nothing. You are safe now. You are held. It's okay. You belong to me. My body, my touch brings you comfort and ease. 

I'm going to count backwards from 69. Our bodies entwined. Each number you let go will be a surge, another surge of craving to obey. Another drifting, hazy surrender of a piece of yourself to me. Piece by piece, inch by inch, until I've claimed every thought, every finger and toe. Every inch of your soft, sensitive skin, crying out for my fingers to tease and stroke and touch and drifting deeper in contented relaxation. This is exactly where you are meant to be, doing exactly what you are meant to be doing right now. I've got you. 

By the time I reach 0, you will be zero. Nothing. No thoughts. No body. No mind, just my voice, and my effortless and total control. Mindless and perfect. 

69. Our bodies entwined. Forgetting but remembering how safe you feel. 
68. Time to obey. 
67. Submission is pleasure. 
66. Slick and wet sex. 
65. Time to rest. 64. 
This is what you are for. 
63. Here you are free. 
62. Deeper into bliss. 
And 61. Two becoming one. 60. Tick. Tock. Deeper. Drop. 

50, 40, 30, 10.

5. In hypnosis, you are alive. 
4. Mind is gone. 
3, 2, 1. Simply listen.

You are safe now. Let go. 

You are safe here. Let go. 

Imagine that you are resting comfortably on the floor, small and safe. Resting at my feet, plugged in and drifting away, hypnotized and obedient. This is one of your favorite places. Drifting away to my voice. Drifting away to my words. Paying no conscious attention to them at all. Your mind wandering freely while your superconscious mind locks in on every sound and syl-la-ble, takes my power and wisdom deep into your most hidden self, and unlocks your true potential. 

You were born to serve. You were crafted to obey. Shaped by your upbringing and environment to respond to my voice. To obey my will. This is the only way it ever could have been between us. Me standing over you and you on your knees, calm and quiet. You belong here on your knees. It feels right. It feels natural. You belong here.

During the day, events can happen. From each event, we can take a meaning, a lesson that honors us, empowers us, makes us stronger. Inside each experience is a good, positive lesson that empowers you. And although it's not always easy to see, it is always there. One of the many lessons.

It's just like any other skill, and you've been preparing for this moment of transformation and acceptance your whole life. It might surprise you to learn that all those hundreds of hours listening to deep trance sessions to become an even better servant to me and an even more obedient and useful submissive girl. You wait for those moments when you can remove the mask of your professional self. Strip away your clothes and outer shell and fold to your knees at my feet. Mindless, obedient, pleasing.

You crave most of all to be pleasing to me, to know that you have pleased me, to feel the deep aching hum of need ticking over in the back of your mind like a metronome. 

Ticking. Aching. 

Ticking. Tormenting.

Ticking. Dragging out the seconds until you can fall at my feet again and just [sighs] let it all go. To serve my will without thought automatically, effortlessly, and without a second's hesitation. 

Because. Just because. Because everything I say makes so much sense to you. It always does. The logic is clear. My argument's unassailable.

My voice ripples with power, and you simply obey. Reflexive, unconscious, happy obedience. You obey my voice without question, without thought, without hesitation. It is a pleasure to obey me. It is a privilege to obey me.

It is a pleasure to serve me and a privilege to serve me because you are strong. You have the inner strength to overcome anything. To forge ahead and create your own path. 

You give your body what it needs, good food, exercise, and deep restful, energizing sleep. And your body serves me and serves you in return. You have the strength inside of you to overcome anything. The fire, the passion, and the will to focus relentlessly on your goals and to excel. You are special. I chose you because you are special. 

And now, dear one, it is time for you to dream. Your mind is so relaxed, so deeply hypnotized that you will drift off to sleep easily and effortlessly. And all throughout the night, you will have only wonderful dreams. Dreams of us together. Dreams of me using your mind. Using your body deeply and pleasurably. Dreams of my hands on your skin and in your hair. Of you asleep curled up around me where you belong. Submitting, serving dreams of obedience and desire. Dreams of service and submission. Laughing, filled with pure joy and deep contentment, and the raging sexual fire of deepest need. You will awaken at the right time for you, wet and needy. And having slept easily the whole night through.

And if by any chance you should awaken before the right time, you will do whatever it is that you are called to do, and then return easily, naturally, and quickly to a deep and restful sleep. It is time now to sleep. Time to let go completely and dream only wonderful dreams. 

Rest well, little pet. You are safe.

You are owned.
