This session was designed just for you. To be listened to over and over again. You should be somewhere warm and comfortable. Somewhere safe where you won't be disturbed. Where you can close your eyes, relax your mind, and allow me to just clean out all the stress and strain before I awaken you in a few minutes' time, feeling refreshed and better than you have in ages. Each time you listen to this recording, the effect will become stronger and stronger. Each time you listen to this recording, your desire to listen again and again will increase. Continuing to listen means that you accept this, that you want this, and that you need this. 

So lie back, close your eyes, and take a deep breath in for me, holding it at the top for 3, 2, 1, and let it go with a sigh. This is how it always starts, with simple breathing. Become aware of your breath. Become aware of the gentle rise and fall of your chest.

With each breath in, your chest rising just a little bit. And with each breath out, your chest falling, exhaling all that tension and stress and sinking down deeper into that warm and wonderful state of relaxation. With each breath you take, you're sinking down deeper into relaxation. With each and every word that I say. Every part of your mind is focusing in completely on the sound of my voice. Allowing my voice to penetrate your mind, to open you up to wonderful new sensations, new experiences, and new pleasures. 

Thoughts may drift into your mind, and that's okay. Just allow them to drift out again. Allow those thoughts to float away like clouds on a warm summer's breeze. I want you to imagine for me that all of your thoughts are trapped inside big, bright, shining soap bubbles. Make those bubbles big and sparkling in the sunlight. Inside each one is trapped, a tiny thought, shattering away.

I'm going to reach out, and with the tip of my finger, I'm going to pop that first bubble. [Pop] And the thought is gone. Gone from your mind, gone from your body, gone completely from your awareness, and you're enjoying this. You're having fun just relaxing. 

Now that second bubble, I'm going to reach up and with the tip of my finger. I'm gonna pop that second bubble, making the thought gone from your mind, gone from your body, gone completely from your awareness. [Pop] Gone. Gone so far away that you can never find it again. If it was important, it can come back to you later. But for right now, your mind is relaxing faster and faster.

And so quickly, rapidly, and then instantly, I'm going to reach up, and with the tip of my finger I'm going to pop all the remaining bubbles of thought, and all the little clouds will disappear. Your mind will become completely empty, free of thought. Are you ready? [Pop] Gone from your mind, gone from your body, gone completely from your awareness. The thoughts are gone. If any of them were important, you can always have them back later, better than before. But now you're completely relaxed and drifting inside my voice, Drifting in your quiet place inside yourself. 

I'm going to count down from 5 to 1. And as I count down, your body and mind will sink into a wonderful state of relaxation.

You'll fall even deeper with every number you hear. You will allow yourself to be swept away by just how good it feels to submit. 

5, 4. Each number doubling the relaxation you feel. 3, 2. Falling faster and faster. 1. Settling down in that quiet place inside yourself. In that quiet place where you can still hear my voice. Where you can still feel my touch.

Still imagine me there with you. But all your thoughts, all your cares and worries are gone from your mind. Gone from your body. And in their place, you feel pleasure and pride in how well you're obeying. I want you to imagine for me now that in the center of your forehead is a third eye, your inner eye. Your inner eye keeps track of you, keeps track of where you are, of what's going on, and whether it's real or not real.

I want you to imagine now that your inner eye is beginning to close. Your inner eye is feeling so heavy, so relaxed that your inner eye is closing all the way down. Until it's closed completely. Until it can no longer keep track of you. No longer tell you what is real or isn't real. Your inner eye is closed all the way down. Now. That's it. 

Each and every time that you use this session to relax, you will emerge feeling better and better. It's almost as though just hearing my voice is reconnecting you to me, allowing you to heal, to repair yourself inside. You love the sound of my voice, and you're slowly but surely becoming addicted to it. You are beginning to crave the sound of my voice each and every day so that each time you listen to any of my recordings, you will fall deeper. You will relax even more perfectly, and you will emerge feeling better and better. 

Your inner eye, the eye you use to keep track of who you are, what's going on, and whether it's real or not is closed all the way down.

My voice is penetrating into the very core of who you are. Sinking in deep so that my words can change you, rearrange you, and leave you feeling wonderful and happy. My voice brings you comfort. My voice brings you clarity. Every time you listen to a recording of my voice, you're falling deeper under my spell. 

In a few moments time I'm going to have you open your eyes, and as you open your eyes you'll feel so good. Relaxed. Energized. Free. Energy will come to you. Energy will come to you.

The only thing that matters right now is letting go and feeling good. You know that listening to this recording is beginning to change you powerfully and permanently from this moment forward. You will find yourself compelled to obey my voice by a part of you that is so much stronger than the conscious part of you. I'm going to count from 1 to 3 now. And as you hear my voice, say the number 3 you'll open your eyes and come all the way out of this relaxing state of mind. Each number will contain a unique and powerful suggestion just for you. Beginning now with 1, 2. Each and every time you listen to a recording of my voice, you feel closer to me in ways you can't begin to explain. You trust the sound of my voice.

And 3. [Snap] Opening your eyes and coming all the way out of this dreamy, drifty state of mind. Opening your eyes and stretching out, feeling wide awake and wonderful. You're now ready to face your day. Until next time, my beautiful.
