#### HypnoKink Educational Content - Books
In no particular order.

Mind Play by Mark Wiseman
The Brainwashing Book by Sleepingirl – Brainwashing and Conditioning.
Kinky NLP by Sleepingirl – Not as good as her first one.
Erotic Hypnosis Scripts by Charlie Bitten – Highly Recommended. Excellent.
Mastering Erotic Hypnosis by James Gordon
Look Into My Eyes by Peter Masters
The Forked Tongue Revisited by Flagg - Has a few chapters addressing Mindfucks and Edgeplay with Hypnosis. Highly Recommended.
The Mind Play Study Guide by Mark Wiseman. For Teaching Classes.

The Mind Whisperer: Erotic Hypnosis Sensual Trance and Beyond by Shane Hill
Instruction of The Hypno Dom by Joseph Crown
Erotic Hypnosis: A Beginner's Crash Course by Alexandra Morris – Femdom Perspective + Scripts. Part of a series of three, most content is in the form of full scripts. Download Book 2. Download Book 3. Particularly good for her different perspective and inclusion of complete scripts.
Combining Sex and Erotic Hypnosis
The Art of Erotic Hypnosis by C. Charles – Pretty crap, listed here only for completeness.
For an Introduction to Hypnosis and combining it with Kink, Fetishism and BDSM
Beyond Games of Trance by Alex Tsander (Direct Download in "Resources Folder - Third Party Resources" section)
Managing a Hypnosis-based Relationship
The Tao of Relationship Maintenance for Mind Controllers by Joseph Crown
Safety Note - Joseph Crowns sections on creating "alters" can cause permanent and dangerous side effects. Avoid using those techniques unless you have been specifically trained in them by a Professional and understand how to resolve and dissolve them. If you require assistance in undoing them or the work of other hypnotists, use the Contact email at the top of this document to get in touch.

#### HypnoKink Educational Content - Discord Servers
Stupidly, the server Owners have disabled the ability to generate Invitation Links (which opens people up to Google Flooding Attacks) but if you search for "CONsolation" you can find the link to a Hypnokink education-focused Discord Server.

#### HypnoKink Educational Content - Hypnosis Software
These are not EROTIC hypnosis applications, they are NORMAL apps for learning hypnosis.
