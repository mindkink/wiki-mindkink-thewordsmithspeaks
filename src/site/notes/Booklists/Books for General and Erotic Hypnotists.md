#### Important – Recommended Learning Pathways
If you would like to learn Erotic Hypnosis, I would strongly recommend the following resource:
https://thewordsmithspeaks.com – My Educational Website, several free recorded classes that are highly specific to learning Erotic Hypnosis and applying it in your Ds or Vanilla Relationship.

**Learning Hypnosis from books is NOT how I recommend you find or build the main body of your skills**, instead I STRONGLY suggest you look at the website above and find one of the several free, recorded classes there where I describe the process in detail using a variety of resources, with clear benchmarks for success and progression and a detailed discussion of traps and pitfalls, supplementary and complementary skillsets (such as Massage, NLP, and others) and provide a community and further resources to guide your progression and growth of skills.

If you would like to learn General Hypnosis, I would strongly recommend the following two resources:

- https://hypnosistrainingacademy.com/ - Everything by Igor Ledowchowski
- https://mikemandelhypnosis.com/ - Everything by Mike Mandel

This listing of books is provided as a reference list only.

#### Notes on learning Therapeutic Techniques
Adding extra techniques from the Erotic or Therapeutic fields (if have been appropriately trained by a qualified professional) can come after a solid basis of experience has been established. There is no need to read all of the books below as there is a significant overlap in content covered.

**A Note of Caution**: Some of these Therapeutic based techniques are significantly more powerful than simple direct suggestion and can result in changes that are difficult to undo. Always consider the end goal, the capabilities and desires of yourself and your subject, and your technical abilities and moral character when going deeper into longer term change. 

My solid advice to you is to always learn how to UNDO an effect, before you learn how to apply it - **and to only apply effects that you personally know how to undo**. If you get stuck and need a hand - contact me for advice using the details at the top of the page and I will help you for free or point you to resources you can use instead.

#### Notes on Learning Hypnosis and Executing Sessions
Hypnosis can be a complex skillset, and for that reason NOT all of it's different facets (Erotic, Therapeutic, Stage, etc) need to be grasped before you actually start practising with a partner, merely the fundamentals.
The basic skills of a successful and effective Hypnosis Session include how to establish authority, how to set up a session, establish boundaries, negotiate content, induce trance, deliver on the experience, handle any negative reactions, and emerge with positive suggestions.

#### General Hypnosis Books

Please note that books are recommended in no particular order.

Most of these books teach or explain Hypnosis in the context of Hypnotherapy, which is not appropriate for use with your intimate partners, so take the techniques you like – but understand the context and refer to the notes above. **Unless it is explicitly desired and consensually agreed to prior to a session, all effects should end at the conclusion of the session.**
