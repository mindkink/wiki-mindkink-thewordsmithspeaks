#### Notes on learning Therapeutic Techniques

Adding extra techniques from the Erotic or Therapeutic fields (if have been appropriately trained by a qualified professional) can come after a solid basis of experience has been established. There is no need to read all of the books below as there is a significant overlap in content covered.

#### General Hypnosis Books

**This listing of books is provided as a reference list only. If you would like to actually learn Erotic Hypnosis, please see the note "Erotic Hypnosis Learning Pathways"**

I recommend everything by the following Authors: Teppo Holmqvist, Micheal Yapko, Milton Erikson

**Hypnosis Books - Intermediate and Advanced Level Texts**

Once you've mastered the basics and have 4 - 6 months of SOLID practice under your belt with either Erotic or Non-Erotic Hypnosis (lets be honest, most of you are probably here to learn how to give your partner wild, incredible orgasms) you can move on to these:

**Managing a Hypnosis-based Relationship**

- [The Tao of Relationship Maintenance for Mind Controllers](https://amzn.to/2lWiNBs) by Joseph Crown

**Safety Note** - Joseph Crowns sections on creating "alters" can cause permanent / difficult to undo and remove and dangerous side effects. Avoid using those techniques unless you have been specifically trained in them by a Professional and understand how to resolve and dissolve them. If you require assistance in undoing them or the work of other hypnotists, use the Contact page to get in touch.
