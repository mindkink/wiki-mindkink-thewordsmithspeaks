IMPORTANT NOTE: Always consider the context of any contract. This one is the end result of weeks of careful negotiation and a deep prexisting relationship.

It is listed here ONLY as a resource and for inspiration and ideas to add to your own agreements. A Contract or any agreement should be carefully negotiated, implemented slowly over time and generally I do not advocate long contracts as they are the BDSM version 1 model.

Instead I advocate for the BDSM version 2 Model which is outlined in the episode "BDSM Contracts 2.0" in the Mind Kink podcast at https://thewordsmithspeaks.com. 

You can always contact me, free of charge, if you have any questions.

AGAIN - do not simply copy and paste a contract, take individual ideas you both like and implement them slowly and cautiously. Change the contract to suit the relationship, not the relationship to suit the contract.

Full honesty is committed to, in all things including feelings, thoughts and actions. There is no need for dishonesty and it is prohibited. If the situation is not one where either party can speak freely, then either party may defer the conversation for a period no longer than 24 hours (see “24 Hour Rule”).

7.6 We agree that X may loan AA to anyone, for any purpose, for a defined time period. Both she and the Responsible Party are subject to the stipulations of this contract. X will ensure that the Responsible Party is informed of their obligations as outlined in this Contract, prior to use. X has the right to revoke this loan at any time, for any reason.
 
8. RULES 
8.1 The 24 hour Rule - There are to be discussion times regarding the relationship or any other issue, concern, need or interest anytime X, or AA feels it is necessary, except when X is using AA, or while AA is being given an instruction. A request for discussion will assure one, within 24 hours at X's convenience. AA is responsible for posting the conversation time in the shared calendar with a minimum of a 90 minute reminder.

8.2 AA is required to fully obey X’s directions. When given instruction, AA will neither negotiate with X, nor hesitate to complete the instruction. AA’s only choice is to ask for clarification, if necessary and obey X. Discussion is allowed later, if needed. Hesitation will be met with corrective measures and punishment. AA will obey the literal and spirit of the direction.

8.3 AA will conduct herself with integrity and self-respect while exhibiting complete loyalty and honour for X.

8.4 AA must display an ability to be totally submissive to X and furthermore display a positive attitude about her relationship choice and having entered this agreement, especially when discussing the relationship with others. Discernible pleasure to be in service to X is AA's predominant outward image and emotion. 

8.5 AA must express her feelings, wants, state of health, likes and dislikes, at all times. A private moment of reflection may be required, following which she will immediately communicate with Master. AA is free to express those needs consistent with her position as a slave, expressing not demanding.

8.6 AA’s speech to X will always reflect a submissive, respectful tone and choice of words. AA will never scream, yell, or argue with X. X provides opportunity and protocol to ensure AA is able to voice all her thoughts and feelings. Use of submissive speech in tone and choice of words is not to restrict expression of thoughts and feelings, but rather to reflect on the unique structure and tenets of this relationship. Speech patterns are enforced to kindle harmony, peace and tranquillity.

8.7 A period of Reflection - A period of reflection and focus is required when AA returns home after absence from X for more than six hours. “Focus” is done sitting comfortably in a spot in her safe place and lasts for a period not less than five minutes. AA will focus during the reflection period to release her daily tensions and concerns outside the relationship dynamic and focus on X, the happiness she feels in his service and the consensual choice made to enter this Contract.

8.8 AA will express her femininity in appearance, behavior and attitude.

8.9 AA will conduct herself with dignity and grace in public.

8.12 AA will accept corrective measures in her heart. AA must learn to understand that when X deems AA to be in error and corrective measures and punishment occurs, she accepts that X has the right and control to make these decisions whether she agrees an error occurred or not.

8.13 AA is forbidden from punishing herself for any perceived or real breaches of her Contract, or any other Rule. If AA believes that she has errored, she must bring the issue to X's attention, using the channels of communication that are open to her as a slave. X’s judgement is final.

8.14 AA has at her disposal “the Laugh Rule”. When AA is due punishment and can make X laugh in context of her disobedience, she may request the invocation of this rule. “The Laugh Rule” when granted, relieves AA of punishment and the Forgive & Forget mechanism of the punishment regimen is immediately in effect, ending the punishment and dismissing the disobedience to ancient history. Asking for the Rule does not automatically grant it, application of the Rule is solely at X’s discretion.

8.15 AA is not permitted the use of chairs, sofas, couches, stools or other furniture to sit on in X’s House, unless specific permission is granted, or there is an absolving need. When in public, AA will be seated as suiting the circumstance and requirements of polite society, and pursuant to House Rules.

8.16 The sanctity of the bathroom is inviolate. When X is in the bathroom and the door is closed AA will not enter unless commanded to.

8.17 AA will be taught additional Protocols exclusive of this Contract and recorded in her Ledger. AA is expected to honour those rules as she would these. Protocols can be altered as X sees fit to reflect change and growth. The Ledger is always available to AA for review. No expectations are imposed on AA until a protocol is taught and recorded.

9. BOUNDARIES

9.1 AA’s Employment - While AA is at work (including travel to and from work), she may dress and act as in the best manner for her workplace. X acknowledges that AA is experienced and knowledgeable in this area and allows her the freedom to act as is best in work situations. AA will always be the best girl she can be and acknowledges that her work is for the betterment of her Master. X agrees not to interfere with AA's work unless it is affecting the Family.
