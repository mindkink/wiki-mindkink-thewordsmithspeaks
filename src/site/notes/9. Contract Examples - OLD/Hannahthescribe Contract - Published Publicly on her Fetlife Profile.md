IMPORTANT NOTE: Always consider the context of any contract. 

It is listed here ONLY as a resource and for inspiration and ideas to add to your own agreements. A Contract or any agreement should be carefully negotiated, implemented slowly over time and generally I do not advocate long contracts as they are the BDSM version 1 model.

Instead I advocate for the BDSM version 2 Model which is outlined in the episode "BDSM Contracts 2.0" in the Mind Kink podcast at https://thewordsmithspeaks.com. 

You can always contact me, free of charge, if you have any questions.

AGAIN - do not simply copy and paste a contract, take individual ideas you both like and implement them slowly and cautiously.

It is included here not as an strict example to copy but for inspiration and thoroughness in it's approach, as well as being well written.

HannahTheScribe is an exceptional educator and as of time of writing I endorse her content without reservation.

She is also an exceptional example of internalised slavery and I strongly encourage paying for her coaching if that is a service she offers.

# Our Contract

This contract is an agreement to a 24/7 live in Mistress/slave dynamic. Kate and Hannah are married; Hannah is Kate's owned and collared slave.

This contract is an exclusive agreement. Both agree to be monogamous. This means no power exchange, romance, kinky play, cohabitating, or sexual activity with other people, unless discussed.

* Making a phone or video call when Kate is present (Hannah will notify her when no longer on the call). If she receives a call, she may answer, and will notify Kate as soon as possible.

* Bedtime leashing protocols are as follows: if Kate is present, Hannah will ask her permission to remove the leash. If Kate is asleep or out of the house, Hannah may remove the leash if needed, and will releash herself upon returning if she does. Leashing or unleashing by Kate will be done in Leashing Position. Hannah will leash herself if Kate is unavailable, or be leashed at evening Inspection. Hannah will sleep on the floor at the foot of the bed.
* When entering Kate's office, Hannah will wait quietly near the entrance until she is acknowledged. If Kate cannot see her from where she is, she may move into the room as needed and wait. If Hannah enters a space Kate is in and does not make eye contact, it will be assumed that she is passing through, retrieving an object, etc., and will not be counted as "in Kate's presence" (and thus not requiring verbal exchange before leaving.)

## Without Vanilla Company Protocols

* When in Kate's presence and not standing, Hannah will assume her General Kneeling Position next to Kate. She will ask Kate's permission before changing position on the floor. She will not sit on the furniture or ask Kate's permission to, unless directed by Kate. This does not apply to the bed. She will wait behind her chair in Waiting Position before meals.
* Before leaving Kate's presence, Hannah will ask if there's anything else she can do to be of service. If yes, she will do so first. When there is nothing else, she will ask for permission to leave. If granted, she will curtsy before she leaves.
* Hannah will respond to orders with, "Yes, Mistress," and permission or favor grants or denials (including restatements) with, "Thank you, Mistress," unless it would be disruptive to the conversation. Response will be based on intention, not phrasing. She will address Kate as Mistress whenever clearly appropriate.

## Positions

Slave positions include:

* General Kneeling Position: kneeling on the floor where directed, knees apart, big toes crossed in back (right over left), hands folded at small of back (right over left, right thumb over left thumb), back straight. She may not shift from this position without permission.
* Leashing Position: kneeling on the floor at foot of bed, knees apart, big toes crossed in back (right over left), leash across both palms, hands resting on thighs, hair/head out of the way, collar o-ring in front, back straight. If Hannah is allowed to sleep in bed, she will sit up cross legged in bed, the rest the same.
* Corner Position: standing facing wall, legs together, arms boxed behind back, nose touching wall, back straight, silent and still unless prompted.
* Inspection Position: standing in front of Kate, legs spread, hands clasped behind head, head/eyes straight, back straight.
* Waiting Position: standing where directed, legs together, hands folded at small of back, right over left, right thumb over left thumb, back straight, head/eyes down. She may not shift from this position without permission.
* Presenting Object Position: "General Kneeling Position", but with object across both palms, hands resting on thighs, head/eyes down. She may not shift from this position without permission.

## Uniform

For Hannah's daily Uniform, she will wear her assigned black and red plaid top, black knee socks, black leggings, black bra, black underwear, collar, and wedding ring. She will keep her pager clipped to her leggings (she may also keep her phone there if desired; headphones are generally permitted). Pager and wedding ring may be removed and set nearby for tasks such as doing dishes. Shoes, if worn, will be the assigned black boots. She may choose her own jackets and bags until told otherwise, and use bathrobes, aprons, masks, and gloves as reasonable. Hannah will sleep nude, except for her collar/leash and wedding ring.

Her clothes should generally look neat, be in good repair, and fit well. She will bathe regularly and shave any body hair each time she showers, keep her bangs at a reasonable length, and keep her nails short. Kate will inspect Hannah's job of shaving immediately after each time she showers, in Inspection Position. Her hair will be left down.

Hannah may add, remove, or change out Uniform clothing items without prior permission if it is necessary to maintain a vanilla facade. She will notify Kate of it as soon as reasonable. Any other visible changes must be approved.

## Daily Inspections

Each day at 10:30 AM, Kate will ensure that Hannah's morning services were adequately completed, and let her know the results either way, handling punishment if necessary. She will inspect Hannah and her uniform in Inspection Position. Hannah will offer Kate sunscreen. This will be skipped on Sundays and happen immediately after Maintenance on Fridays.

Each day at 9:20 PM, Kate will ensure that Hannah's evening services were adequately completed, and let her know the results either way, handling punishment if necessary. She will inspect Hannah nude in Inspection Position and then leash her for the night. Hannah will offer Kate lotion.

## Punishment

Hannah is subject to being punished by Kate. When Kate decides that Hannah should be punished, she will use the following method to do so.

* Hannah will be instructed to fetch the Discipline Wand and go to the bedroom.
* Hannah will wait in the Presenting Object Position, nude, and presenting the Discipline Wand until directed otherwise.
* Before spanking, Kate will prompt Hannah for why she is being punished.
* Kate will spank Hannah with the Discipline Wand in a position of her choosing, specifying if she is to count (format: "One, thank you, Mistress, please may I have another?")
* Hannah will be sent to the corner for some amount of time after her spanking, Corner Position.
* Kate will release Hannah from corner time at the conclusion of her punishment.

## Facing Issues

Both agree to raise issues verbally for small issues, and in writing for more involved issues. The written report will include what happened to trigger the report, how it made the person feel, why they felt that way, what can be done to make it better right now, and what needs to be true for this to not happen again. The issue will be raised as soon as possible within reason.

## Light Slave Duty

Light Slave Duty is the term used to describe a period of time when Hannah will have reduced duties, due to illness, etc. Hannah may request Light Slave Duty, or request to be off of Light Slave Duty. Kate will decide when Light Slave Duty is in effect, and communicate this to Hannah.

While in effect, the following changes are observed:

* Daily Inspections shall be skipped with no punishment.
* Service & Routine tasks may be skipped with no punishment.
* Schedule items may be skipped.
* Uniform code is relaxed; Hannah may wear pajamas at will.
* Hannah may sleep in the bed.

## Understanding

The dynamic follows a total irrevocable consent model of M/s, and Hannah will not invoke safewords, limits, relationship termination, or any other form of refusal. This contract is a tool to communicate the current understandings and cannot be "enforced" from Hannah's side. Kate may verbally make exceptions to, add to, remove, or change its contents, and will endeavor to maintain the overall integrity of the agreement as a matter of honor rather than due to enforceability. If Kate chooses to dissolve the dynamic, she agrees to do so in a reasonable manner after due communication, and be open to ongoing discussion on further agreements. 

## Publishing

This document will be considered published when it has been printed out and signed by Kate and Hannah. At that time, it is considered in effect and remains so until and unless replaced.
