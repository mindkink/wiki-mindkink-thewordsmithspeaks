PLEASE NOTE: I do not recommend or endorse this model of contract. I believe it to be unwieldy and unnecessarily constraining, and IT IS INCLUDED HERE ONLY TO PROVIDE IDEAS OR INSPIRATION TO ADD TO YOU OWN CONTRACT, NOT TO SIMPLY COPY. IT IS BETTER TO HAVE NO CONTRACT THAT THE WRONG CONTRACT WHICH LEADS YOU ASTRAY.

I advocate for a different model which I outline in detail in the BDSM Contracts 2.0 Episode on the Mind Kink Podcast. Please contact me if you have any questions.

AGAIN, do not just copy paste this contract, use it ONLY as inspiration and ideas and follow the process of implementation that I outline in the podcast episode above.

Reading through this as a I post it to the Wiki, a huge amount of this is simply unnecessary, hugely constraining and not in a useful way, and I DO NOT ADVOCATE for this model of contract

Instructions on how to modify this contract to suit your needs:
1.	Read each clause extremely carefully.
2.	Fully think through in implications of adding each clause to your Contract.
3.	Do a “find and replace” with Australia and your Country.
4.	Replace MASTER with your chosen name, as appropriate and if desired..
5.	Replace SLAVE with their chosen name, as appropriate and if desired..
6.	Do not include any clause in your contract without knowing what it means, what the likely ramifications are, and being completely willing to enforce it consistently with your slave.
7.	In Section 9: Boundaries you will need to add in your slaves boundaries – she will have some, as will you. Setting firm Boundaries and never crossing them will build your slaves trust in you.
8.	Print a physical copy and put it up where you and your Slave can see it and read it often.

Spaces have been left between the paragraphs so that you can write your own notes, observations and thoughts. When you finalise the contract, tidy it up.

This document is intended as a reference in developing your own customised Master Slave Contract. It is  thorough, while still being direct and to-the-point. It it not a D / s Contract, it is intended for Masters and slaves desiring to enter into a full time, Total Power Exchange Master / Slave dynamic. It is highly specific to those desires and should not be adapted to suit a different relationship style.

This Contract is taken nearly verbatim from the book “Devil in the Details, Vol. 3” by LT Morrison. All credit goes to the original author, who I have made every effort to contact and seek his permission to reproduce this resource here. It is an excellent book series and I encourage you to purchase a copy. A thorough understanding of its contents will elevate your Mastery.

8.1 There are to be discussion times regarding the relationship or any other issue, concern, need or interest anytime Master, or Slave feels it is necessary, except when Master is using the Slave, or while the slave is being given an instruction. A request for discussion will assure one, within twenty-four hours and at Master's convenience.

8.2 Slave is required to fully obey Master’s directions. When given instruction, Slave will neither negotiate with Master, nor hesitate to complete the instruction. Slave’s only choice is to ask for clarification, if necessary and obey Master. Discussion is allowed later, if needed. Hesitation will be met with corrective measures and punishment. Slave will obey the literal and spirit of the direction.

8.3 Slave will conduct herself with integrity and self-respect while exhibiting complete loyalty and honour for Master.

8.4 Slave must display an ability to be totally submissive to Master and furthermore display a positive attitude about her relationship choice and having entered this agreement. Discernable pleasure to be in service to Master is Slave's predominant outward image and emotion.

8.5 Slave must express her feelings, wants, state of health, likes and dislikes, at all times. Slave is free to express those needs consistent with her position as Slave, expressing not demanding.

8.6 Slave’s speech to Master will always reflect a submissive, respectful tone and choice of words. Slave will never scream, yell, or argue with Master. Master provides opportunity and protocol to ensure Slave is able to voice all her thoughts and feelings. Use of submissive speech in tone and choice of words is not to restrict expression of thoughts and feelings, but rather to reflect on the unique structure and tenets of this relationship. Speech patterns are enforced to kindle harmony, peace and tranquility.

8.7 A period of reflection and focus is required when Slave returns home after absence from Master for more than six hours. “Focus” is done on her knees (CHANGE THIS IF YOUR SLAVE CANNOT KNEEL) in a spot designated by Master and lasts for a period not less than five minutes.

8.13 Slave has at her disposable the Laugh Rule. When Slave is due punishment and can make Master laugh in context of her disobedience, she may request invocation of this rule. The Laugh Rule when granted, relieves Slave of punishment and the Forgive & Forget mechanism of the punishment regimen is immediately in effect, ending the punishment and dismissing the disobedience to ancient history. Asking for the Rule does not automatically grant it, application of the Rule is solely at Master’s discretion.

8.14 Master’s collar is to be worn by Slave at all times when in the home, unless guests who might be offended by it, or not understand, are present. Master will provide a more discreet marking of ownership available to Slave for use inside and outside the home where discretion is required.
