IMPORTANT NOTE: I do not endorse or recommend this contract. It was shared with me by a friend and included here ONLY for ideas and inspiration. 

This contract is wildly useless. Deeply "culty" and following it led to a profoundly unhappy relationship for this person, in my opinion it is too restrictive and lacks heart.

AGAIN, do not use this contract, it is included here only for completeness.

Ownership

- Ownership = Reciprocal Gifting
- Part 1: a sub gives her life in total submission to her Dom.
- Part 2: a Dom takes total responsibility for the life given in submission.

Contradictions of Submission

1. Without strength, there is no submission.
- A weak person cannot submit.
2. In pain, there is joy.
- With punishment, there is a cleansing of wrongs and total forgiveness.
- No fighting to be right, but fighting to keep bond of submission.
- Pain releases endorphins and creates happiness.
3. In bondage, there is freedom.
- When your body or mind is tied up, then you can do nothing without your Dom. The weight and responsibility of life then shifts to your Owner, and you are free.
4. In submission, there is power.
- When a sub is totally pleasing to her Dom, then she becomes valued and obtains power. In this situation, care must be taken to avoid "topping from the bottom".

Principles of Submission (PRO GOT CUM)

Pleasing

- Pleasing is your primary goal.
- Pleasing is being part of your Owner.
- His goals are your goals - not the other way around.
- Always anticipate how you can serve Him.
- Pleasing is both the goal AND reward.

Respect

- Grammar - always use respectful spelling (Wwe, Uus, Oour). Always refer to Dom with honorific (Master, Sir, Daddy) and use it once in every written message. Always be the last to reply to a message.
- Speech - never swear. Never asks questions to your Dom, but "would it please You?" Never use no words (no, can't, not, won't, don't, shouldn't). Never use sarcasm.
- Thought - always be respectful in thought to your Owner, you have assigned power and right to Him.
- Action - read daily and follow these Rules. Submission is specific, you may not talk to other Doms.
- Emotion - never be upset, grumpy, moody, angry, jealous, frustrated, irritated with your owner. Always be pleasing, respectful and obedient.
- Gratitude - be grateful for everything you get, because you have nothing without your Owner.

Obedience

- Immediate
- Cheerful
- Eager


Gratitude

- Ownership = Total Power Exchange
- Owner has all the power, and you have none. Owner can do anything, you can only do what He tells you to.
- Then everything you have or get to do is received with gratitude.
- Abundance VS Scarcity - a sub can only live in abundance. Scarcity comes from comparing or competing.
- Inner focus VS Outer focus - a sub can only live in outer focus. Inner focus is self centredness.
- When a sub is Abundant and Outer Focused, they feel gratitude and happiness. When a sub is in Scarcity and Inner Focused, they feel jealousy, depression, anxiety, conflict, anger, irritation, guilt, frustration and stress.
- Whenever a sub experiences these negative emotions, she must be open with her owner so he can direct her back to Abundance and Outer Focus.

Openness

- Thoughts - Keep no secrets from your Owner. He should know all your passwords, accounts, etc. When you are in submission, you give all of your life; not just part of it.
- Emotions - Whenever you have negative emotions, you should always be open with your Owner about them.
- Body - Never hide your body from your owner. No hair except on your head as a sign of your openness.
- Time - Always ask permission before leaving the house. Always text Owner whenever you leave/arrive somewhere until you return home.
- Pleasure - Dom owns your pleasure. Do not give pleasure to yourself or others.
- Past - Always be open with your past, so your Owner can guide your present and future.

Trust

- Trust as an action, not just a feeling.
- In all life, you are either growing or dying. Stasis is a slow death.
- In submission, growing means constantly challenging your boundaries through goals set by your Owner.
- Trust breaks the vanilla defensive wall. Sarcasm increases the wall. PMS increases the wall.
- The importance of "burning the boat."

Courage

- Growth and challenging boundaries only occurs with courage.
- In vanilla, humiliation and pain are used to destroy you. In submission, they are used to free you.
- Physical fear (fight or flight) saves your life VS Emotional fear (False Experiences Appearing Real) steals your life.
- Fear increases the defensive wall. Pleasing means you have no wall between your Owner and yourself.
- "Let go of the banana" of fear to be free.
- Einstein said doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result was the definition of insanity.

Unconditional Love

- The purest statement of unconditional love is "Ã¬ would do anything for You."
- Love as an action, not just a feeling.
- Love in vanilla (felt) VS submission (given).
- Unconditional love in vanilla (still conditional) VS submission (unconditional).
- Whenever a sub decides which Rules she follows or not, then her love is not unconditional (topping from the bottom).

Mindfulness

- Present - a sub can only act in the present, so she is only alive in the present. The past has gone, and the future has not arrived yet. The past is left to be healed by your Owner, the future is left in the hands of your Owner. Focus only on being pleasing, respectful and obedient in the present. Whenever you are in the past or the future you will experience negative emotions so hand these over to your Owner and He will put you back in the present.
- Pleasing - always be mindful of what your Owner is feeling and what He needs. Seek to be inside Him, to be part of Him, to anticipate His needs. Pleasing is your primary goal.
- Priority - Does your Owner come first before anything else, including yourself (hunger, tiredness, pain etc). Never have addictions (drugs, food, alcohol,gambling, depression, sugar, caffeine, phone, Facebook) because then your Owner becomes second to these.
- Perspective - put your worries and your life into perspective and look at the bigger picture. Realise that it's no big deal and that your Owner will take care of everything. The voice makes a big deal out of everything but just remember that you have a blessed life and no real worries. Realise how truly lucky you are.
