This list was made for the **legions** of Heterosexual Male Dominants out there not currently being given any real guidance in how to progress in their relationships or in their development and evolution as powerful and worthy Dominants.

There is a lot out there for Gay Men, for Leather (Dr Bob Rubel is an excellent source for information into that particular subculture) but the huge majority of growing and upcoming Dominants are not being welcomed into the harmonious relationships, the happiness, the power and Ownership that is their birthright as Men, and this list is for them.

Many good Male Self-Improvement and Business texts are also very valuable, particularly ones around improving your Executive abilities.

**Note:** Even if a Dominant chooses not to go deeply into Mastery (and that is his right, it is a very full-on life and the overwhelming majority of people will be truly happier as Dominants), it is still very valuable for him to have an understanding of the area and take what practices and concepts he might wish to take from it. In that respect LT Morrisons books are somewhat recommended, though caution should be taken as they can be limiting, and much of their content (particularly most of the second book on Contract Structure) is now incredibly out of date.

Much effort has been made to eliminate any texts that are anti-male - if you encounter the occasional paragraph of nonsense in the books below, rest assured they are by far the best of the possible options and skip over those sections completely with my blessing.

I highly recommend that you spend at MINIMUM three full years exploring everything that this field has to offer before deciding that you are or are not a Dominant, Switch, Submissive, etc. Labels are inherently constraining, it is far better to identify simply as “Yourself” with a list of things you like, that buy into the idea that you must observe a random strangers ideas of who or what you are.

Better yet, choose to simply identify as Yourself for the entire time you explore this, and to not fall victim to the idea that you need broader society or “mainstream” kink groups to like you, to approve of you, or to grant you permission to enjoy yourself. You don’t need them, and you never did, and you never will. Choose for yourself your own path and you will find the company you find along that road far better suited than any other. The Forked Tongue Revisited by Flagg has an excellent final chapter and epilogue which may inspire.

**NOTE** – The Episode on Contracts 2.0 is vastly superior to all other BDSM Contracts in the Resources Folder and supersedes them.
