First, learn how to say no to people.
Second, learn effective strategies for meeting your needs.
Third, develop an empowering personal philosophy.
Fourth, learn more about being a Man.

The first thing we'll do is teach you about your Boundaries and how to say no to people - because if you can't say no to people, you can't ever really say yes to the things in life that truly make YOU happy. This can be a scary thing, but I promise you it’s worth it - you'll get through it. We'll discuss how to find and define boundaries with yourself and with others. Then we'll build an empowering Personal Philosophy of Life, that encourages strength and reflects your masculine nature, embraces who you are and what makes you feel happy, complete and powerful as a man.

Its a simple, staged process that builds on itself. I know that you can do this, and I believe in you. Yes, you.

The resource's in this list have been chosen because they are: cheap, accessible and easy to read. Study them in order from top to bottom and you'll notice how the concepts all fit together and build on the topics that came before.

**Note:** If you don't like to or have the time to read, then Audiobooks are a perfectly reasonable alternative.
