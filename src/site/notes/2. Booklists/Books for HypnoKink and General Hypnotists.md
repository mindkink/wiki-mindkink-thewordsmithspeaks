#### Notes on learning Therapeutic Techniques

Adding extra techniques from the Erotic or Therapeutic fields (if have been appropriately trained by a qualified professional) can come after a solid basis of experience has been established. There is no need to read all of the books below as there is a significant overlap in content covered.

#### General Hypnosis Books

Hypnosis in it's entirety is a complex skillset, and for that reason not all of it's different facets (Erotic, Therapeutic, Stage, Comedy, etc) need to be grasped before you actually start practising with a partner, merely the fundamentals. The basic skills of a successful and effective Hypnosis Session include how to establish authority, how to set up a session, establish boundaries, negotiate content, induce trance, deliver on the experience, handle any negative reactions, and emerge with positive suggestions. Adding extra techniques from the Erotic or Therapeutic fields (if have been appropriately trained by a qualified professional) can come after a solid basis of experience has been established. For that, any one of the books below in the Introductory Texts will do, there is no need to read all of them as there is a significant overlap in content covered.

**A Note of Caution:** Some of these Therapeutic based techniques are significantly more powerful than simple direct suggestion and can result in changes that are difficult to undo. Always consider the end goal, the capabilities and desires of yourself and your subject, and your technical abilities and moral character when going deeper into longer term change. 

Most of these books teach or explain Hypnosis in the context of Hypnotherapy, which is not appropriate for use with your intimate partners, so take the techniques you like – but understand the context and refer to the notes above. **Unless it is explicitly desired and consensually agreed to prior to a session, all effects should end at the conclusion of the session.**

My solid advice to you is to always learn how to UNDO an effect, before you learn how to apply it - and to only apply effects that you personally know how to undo. If you get stuck and need a hand - contact me for advice using the contact page.

**Learning Hypnosis from books is NOT how I recommend you find or build the main body of your skills**, instead I STRONGLY suggest you look at the website above and find one of the several free, recorded classes there where I describe the process in detail using a variety of resources, with clear benchmarks for success and progression and a detailed discussion of traps and pitfalls, supplementary and complementary skillsets (such as Massage, NLP, and others) and provide a community and further resources to guide your progression and growth of skills.

**If you would like to learn General Hypnosis, I would strongly recommend the following two resources:**

- https://hypnosistrainingacademy.com/ - Everything by Igor Ledowchowski

I recommend everything by the following Authors: Teppo Holmqvist, Micheal Yapko, Milton Erikson

Once you've mastered the basics and have 4 - 6 months of SOLID practice under your belt with either Erotic or Non-Erotic Hypnosis (lets be honest, most of you are probably here to learn how to give your partner wild, incredible orgasms) you can move on to these:

**Further General Hypnosis Educational Resources**

**A Free Introductory Audio Program on Hypnosis - "Hypnosis Exposed"**

[Get the audio lectures here](https://hypnosistrainingacademy.com/free/gift/foryou/) - A free set of three audio lectures, explaining to the complete beginner what Trance and Hypnosis is, and how to create it.

**Learning General Hypnosis - The HLSS Cards**

[Get these Cards](https://hypnosistrainingacademy.com/hypnotic-language-shortcut-system) - They are free ($6 for shipping) and they come with a series of videos on their use. They are the single most effective tool I have found for creating and teaching effective hypnotists, and this includes erotic hypnotists. (Though the cards themselves are not erotic in nature, it's very simple to layer in erotic content when you practice). **Buy them, use them**. You will have to click through a few pages of marketing fluff on the website to get to the purchase page, just scroll down and move forward. They are worth it.

#### Erotic Hypnosis Books I commonly recommend

Learning Erotic Hypnosis is **easy, fun and safe** - you read the right books in the right order, practice frequently with a partner you trust, learn to go into trance yourself so you know what it feels like, and avoid the pitfall of too much reading and theory, and not enough action and practice. Within 3 months, you can go from know-nothing beginner to accomplished intermediate.

**I did a whole Podcast specifically on Learning Erotic Hypnosis, check that out for more details and a full learning pathway.**

When it comes to learning, reading one book properly is worth a thousand disjointed tumblr posts.

**The most important thing**

The most important thing to remember is this: **Erotic Hypnosis is just a subset of ordinary Hypnosis Techniques with some sexy content thrown in** - the same techniques still apply (Erotic Hypnosis can be considered a subset of a broader category of "Hypnosis" of which Stage and Therapeutic work are also subsets). Learning general hypnosis will make you a better erotic hypnotist - once that solid,practised hypnotic technique is combined with some awesome, sexy content. Take inspiration from everywhere - I myself have taken inspiration for some of my best Scenes from Nanotechnology, the physics of how stars form and function, the growth of plants, how to knit, Harry Potter (Imperius Curse anyone?), the TV show Tru Blood (Vampirism and being drained of will and strength, compulsion, ownership and hierarchy - this show is a gold mine), Pharmacology, books, movies, broader or famous scenes in media. You can use anything you and your partner enjoy to take both of you on a journey of fun, domination, sexy awakening, or just plain old brainwashing.

Below you will find a fairly comprehensive list of hypnosis and erotic hypnosis specific textbooks and written resources, the result of many years of my own reading, study and research. For further content on the subject of Erotic Hypnosis check out the resources page for some good EH podcasts, websites and other useful software, educational resources, etc. Mark Cunninghams Essential Renegade Hypnosis is good but definitely not for people without a strong foundational skillset and a developed sense of ethics.

**Further Erotic Hypnosis Educational Resources**

**The Essential Renegade Hypnosis by Mark Cunningham**

[Purchase it here](https://renegadehypnotist.com/essentialrenegadehypnosis/). An Intermediate-level video and audio course of study detailing a proven process to use erotic hypnosis to create more empowered and more sensual women and men. Ignore marketing page, this stuff works, it works incredibly well, and its a core part of my relationships. He's an excellent Hypnotist but his stuff will be completely incomprehensible unless you already know how the pieces work, so study other stuff first then come to this later. He's a pioneer and trailblazer in this field, an all around great guy and is actively developing some cutting edge stuff.
