### What Problem Does This Solve

Your partner wants to create a meaningful gift of their recorded voice for you, but does not know what to say or how to do it.

This project solves this problem by providing high quality script pieces in a standard format, with a modular emphasis and clear annotations included, so you can effortlessly assemble a full script that is effective, then modify it to make it unique to your partner (change names, locations, themes, etc) and then record it as a gift to them.

### Why do all this

Because your partners voice is more meaningful than you probably realise. Your partners voice can uplift you, even on the other side of the world and weeks apart. They can reach out and touch you, and help you to sleep, or guide you into relaxing fully, and make you feel warm and obedient and free. They can comfort you through dark nights and cold afternoons, keep you company through hours of chores at home, and be a constant, warm presence in your life.

And they can reach deep inside, into your deepest fantasies and bring them to life, make them real and carry you into incredible adventures, relive amazing memories and past adventures together, and daydream of new ones. They can create anticipation for future time together, reassure you of how special and unique you are to them, and keep your connection deep, pure and alive no matter how long it's last been since they were inside you.

Because creating an audio recording is a gift that you can give your partner **that they will use for years**. I still have audio gifts from past partners that I listen to often when resting. Your partner will be able to use it when you are physically present or when you are distant, they will be able to listen to it when the time zones prevent a live call, or work schedules would otherwise interrupt, because they were able be able to reach for your voice to comfort and guide them whenever they want to without constraints of time, space, availability or you simply being in the mood to deliver a session off-the-cuff. It will never tarnish, or degrade, and your Voice, love and desire will be captured in this form forever.

Because to paraphrase Severus Snape, I can teach you how to to bottle desire, brew submission, and even put a stopper in time.

If your relationship is in-person, they can easily listen to a recording of your voice in one ear while you fuck them or hypnotise them in real-time in the other ear, creating an extremely and profound and restorative trance state. If your relationship is more long distance, they can listen to your voice in the background while they do chores, or when they fall asleep, (see the podcast episode on Bracketing and the construction of effective brainwashing material for more details on this process).

Obviously audio files are not meant to replace in-person or live sessions with your partner, however there has been a noticeable increase in the quality of live sessions as hypnotists unconsciously incorporate script components they have learned through creating recordings, that are of by default higher quality. Basically, using high-quality scripts to construct custom recordings for their partner then goes on to improve the quality of the live sessions that hypnotist delivers for their partner.

### What makes this better than existing systems

Well effectively there is no existing system. Scripts are very commonly not distributed, I’ve lost count of the number of times people have spent hours transcribing by hand the contents of an audio recording so they can learn and understand the process. Thankfully using DeepGram (a custom and very accurate AI) to transcribe audios it’s very, very, very, cheap and extremely fast, but the scripts should still be distributed by default.

When scripts are available, which is not very commonly, they are presented as monolithic blocks with no annotation or explanation.

If you are familiar with software design, the following analogy is appropriate. You have the binary file of something but not the source code. So you need to learn how to decompile the binary back into something resembling usable source code, even then what you have is often abbreviated, minified, and lacks any kind of commenting or annotation. You must spend an absurd amount of time teasing out it's intention, often through labour and mistakes. Then you have to rework this into something usable so that you can learn and understand and make a small change or improvement.

We provide scripts as part of the source code of an audio recording, and then we create simplicity and ease of accessibility by breaking them into modular blocks which represent the major sections of an audio recording, and then additionally providing clear annotations in-line to make modification and alteration easier and simpler.

### How it Works - Simply Explained

Pick an Induction, then a Thought Clearing Section, then a Desired Effects section, then an Emergence section, and combine them all in order, to create a completed script. Then record it and give it to your partner.

### How it Works - In Detail

The objective of this project is to create extremely high quality recording for your partner, as simply as possible and to make it accessible so that anyone can do it, even those with no experience in hypnosis or creating recordings.

We will do this by providing a format for the included scripts that is clearly sectioned by where they would fit into the linear path of a script, along with comments and annotations to describe intended effects to allow for modifications as needed. You will combine each piece of a script from the sections as you wish to, then you can record it using the instructions in the "Recording Instructions" section.

### Notes on Structure

All scripts are broken up into one of the following categories:

- Preframing
- Induction
- Thought Clearing
- Desired Effects
- Mantric Repetition
- Emergence

Then, we list all of the content in an outline commented out at the beginning of the block.

As an example of this: 

Section Describing Induction
Benefits of Submitting
Mantras and Loops
Deepener

### Limitations of this Approach

Can possibly lead to thinking too rigidly, however this will only be a problem much later and can easily be avoided by blurring lines between sections once familiarity is obtained. Risk is minimal and easily rectified.

Also, Dynamic approaches are hard to define statically (in audio file format) but can often be done with an understanding of the underlying constructs and specific adaptions can be made for most dynamic techniques.
