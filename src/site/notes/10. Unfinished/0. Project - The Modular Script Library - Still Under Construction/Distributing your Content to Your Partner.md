The best thing to do is create a free Filen account (links are at the bottom) then a specific shared folder for your Partner and add a VERY simple password if you like. Then they can click the link, enter the password, download it to their phone easily, and listen to it by installing VLC media player application onto their device.

An alternative method is to install Signal on your desktop, and use that to send the audio file to your partner through Signal as a file. Then can then save it to their phone using VLC and play it as they wish to.
