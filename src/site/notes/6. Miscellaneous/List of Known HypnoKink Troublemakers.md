## So whats going on here, why does this list exist?

This list is a self defense tool, to protect you from the negative mental health effects of online drama.

**Hypnokink is FULL of Bullies. Or as the South Park Episode put it - "PC Babies"**

If you're new to the existence of Erotic Hypnosis in general, after a couple of months you probably look around and think "this is such an amazing and cool thing, you can do so much with it! But where are all the talented hypnotists?"

- Where are all the self-aware and intelligent mentally healthy submissive's?

- Why is everyone so angry and prejudiced all the time?

- Why can't people just get along?

- Why does everything have to be so damn POLITICAL?

- Why does everybody who does this online suck so fucking much as a person?

- Is this REALLY all there is?

The answer is that there are heaps of people that do this in-person and in real life, they simply don't connect with anyone ONLINE because of the absolutely **incredible** amount of drama and toxicity that the people on the list below help to propagate - which actively drives out high-quality people from this community. That is the point of it, actually.

At this point basically every content creator with more than a few recordings has been accused of multiple consent violations. Notice accused, not proven. Now either every. single. person. who does this is completely evil / a witch, or there is a highly organised small handful of people with torches and pitchforks looking for witches who are pushing an agenda. 

- They do this because this gives them power over other people who then become afraid of them.

They often do this because it is easier to pretend to be some noble warrior protecting the innocent from evil, than to realise that THEY are the Bad Guys (TM.

They're basically the Nazis.

The answer is that essentially everybody who values their mental health has been specifically driven out by some of the people on the list below, to the point where it can be very hard to find stable, mentally healthy people to play with, at least online.

#### How to Spot a Troublemaker

This is a list of people that create meaningless and pointless drama, that do things like form witch hunting mobs to destroy anyone they disagree with. They also do a lot of "whisperkillings" (where you say something like "I heard X did something so terrible that I can't even tell you what it is and they are unsafe / evil / just a moron but you should still never speak to them and warn everyone about them. Because if you don't, then you're just as bad as them. But I won't tell you what they did) - 

**HINT** whatever they are saying is usually a clever lie.

Here are some of the things they'll say:

(All of the quoted text in the next few paragraphs are from screenshots of messages people have sent to me as specific examples and are representative of typical examples)

- "X person did something so bad they we don't even allow you to mention their name and you can be banned just for mentioning them. But don't ask me for any evidence of what they did because I can't give you any."

- "Asking someone for evidence is traumatising."

- "If you don't specifically attack X person, then you support them. If you support them, then you are just as guilty of whatever they did as they are and you should be ashamed and we hate you now and you should leave."

Tactic - Not allowing you to even hear both sides of a story - they don't want you thinking for yourself.

- "Disagreeing with me is violence."

- "We are all watching and we will never let them forget that we are always watching"

- "If you don't agree with me, the you are a bad person." (the bad spelling is intentional, it's a quote)

Tactic - Keeping an argument going FOREVER, just grinding the person down until they apologise. Once they apologise, they attack twice as hard.

The logic is so twisted that it's doing semicircles, but it makes sense - if the goal was never to inform or help, but to exert power and control.

It was never about helping others, it has always been about destroying anyone they disagree with and having power over what is allowed.

**NOTE - Under no circumstances do I advocate Doxxing** – that is revealing anyone's real name, real location, real place of employment etc - Anything beyond their online username so that you can block them and get on with your life. This list specifically and deliberately includes only Fetlife usernames and Discord usernames so you know who to keep an eye out for it and comment threads when they start ganging up on people.

It's also really nice to send someone who is being attacked a private message just letting them know they aren't alone.

#### What to look out for?

Hypnokink Online is filled with people that like to create pointless drama because their lives are empty and otherwise meaningless.

They would rather spend hours arguing with strangers online than be outside, living life. These people are **dangerous** to others. They kill entire communities with their drama.

**Notice** that where you see one of them attacking someone, you tend to see the same handful of people backing them up.

**Notice** that none of them produce their own content or stuff, they just tear down people who actually DO THINGS and build things.

**Notice** how they seem to have an ENDLESS amount of time to carry on pointless internet arguments that do nothing but hurt people so they can exert power over them.

#### What should I do about this?

Laugh at them. Don't take them seriously - they are not serious people. Think for yourself, and examine critically both sides of an issue. Ask to see the evidence, objectively, and not the opinion pieces and doctored screenshots.

If you like getting involved in pointless drama, then watch. Notice the things listed above. Realise that they are organised, as a group, that they exist only to tear down others and never to actually DO anything or BUILD anything.

If you have a life that you want to live, treat this list like a pre-emptive blocklist. Join Fetlife or Discord, then preemptively block these people and ta da - heaps less drama in your life.
