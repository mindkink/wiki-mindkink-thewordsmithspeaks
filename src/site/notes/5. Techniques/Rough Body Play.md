## Safety and Preparation

Beware of Hard Surfaces and Sharp Edges also Jewelry and High Heels. Make the "where" you are going to do this safe BEFORE the scene by removing those things. Remember that "fast" is not as good as "slower and controlled", let her feel the inexorable force of your dominance, rather than you randomly lashing out at her.

## Negotiating the Scene

Most Kinksters are aroused by **behaviour**.

Most Important Question - "What is the Story that this scene is intending to tell?"

**Inclusive vs Exclusive Negotiation** There are two types of negotiation (they can be combined) Inclusive and Exclusive. **Inclusive is the best**. Inclusive lists all of the things you both want, shared desires and meaningful experiences together. Exclusive lists everything you DONT want, and thus provides no inherent direction towards what you do actually want. See the One Pager on Planning a Scene - thewordsmithspeaks.com

# Basic Skills

Hair Pulling - Take a large fist full of hair close to the scalp.

Face Slapping - Cup one side of her face gently. With the other hand, three middle fingers ONLY on the "meat" of her cheek. Start at a 1 out of 10 force and calibrate. DO NOT allow her to move. Have her close her eyes so it's a surprise.

Punching - Also known as "Deep Impact". ONLY hit the top of the boob, the butt, the outer thighs, the UPPER back.  Start at 0 of 10 and calibrate up. Do not let your ego carry you away.  Be gentler than you think.

Kicking - Involves a lot more force than punching. Start at 0 of 10 and calibrate up. Do not let your ego carry you away. Be gentler than you think.

Biting - Don't break the skin. Gently bite the large muscles - tops of shoulders, calves, OUTER thighs, top of breasts, ass. Avoid hands and forearms, inner thigh and sides of neck. Be gentler than you think.

Choking - LITERALLY rest your hand on their throat and use LITERALLY no force of any kind. DO NOT DO BREATHPLAY UNLESS YOU HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY TRAINED IN HOW TO DO THIS, IN PERSON BY A SOMEONE WHO TEACHES A CLASS ON BREATHPLAY SPECIFICALLY AND ALWAYS COMPARE NOTES FROM IN PERSON CLASSES WITH MULTIPLE EDUCATORS.

If there is ANY doubt in your mind that you cannot do this perfectly safely, just rest your hand on their throat and the psychological effect will be very similar.

DO NOT let her or anyone else urge or shame you into choking them. Don't drink and drive, even a little. Don't choke unless you meet the above conditions.

Also be aware that oxygen deprivation is cumulative, so if you are actually choking them, they will need longer and longer periods to recover and will become oxygen deprived in shorter and shorter periods of time.
