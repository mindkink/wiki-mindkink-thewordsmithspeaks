You are listening to me now because you've chosen to give some time out of your day to yourself for pleasure and for relaxation. You should be somewhere warm and safe where you won't be disturbed, for around 15 minutes or so, wearing nothing but a pair of panties if you can do so safely.

Take a deep breath in, all the way in, hold at the top for three, two, one, and let it go with a sighing as you close your eyes and sleep now. Your body's sagging down like a puppet with no strings, your eyes closing gently and easily, your mind instantly emptying of thought.

It's becoming so hard to think, so easy to listen. You want me to do the thinking for you, because good girls don't think. Good girls obey, and you are my good girl, aren't you, pet?

With each slow and gentle breath, your mind is sinking deeper under my spell. With each word that I say, your unconscious mind is focusing in on the sound of my voice and allowing my voice to dominate your mind completely.

Now your thoughts are gone and my words are becoming your thoughts. You think what I say, you feel what I describe. My words are your thoughts. You have no resistance to your own thoughts. And even if you want to try to resist, it would only add strength to that part of you which craves to obey and fall deeper. Any resistance only makes you fall even more deeply under my control. So you can see that there's no escaping now. It's too late. You'll have to listen to the rest before you have a chance to choose whether to listen again.

And you already know that you want to listen again, don't you, pet? My voice is slipping inside, slipping into all the cracks and crevices and hidden secret places of your mind and filling them with pleasure. My voice is pleasure. Submission to my voice is pleasure. It does feel so good to give in to my control. Each time you obey perfectly, you are rewarded instantly with pure, perfect pleasure, warm and tingling and so, so strong.

The pleasure overwhelms your defences, ensuring that you'll always do exactly what I tell you to. And what I want you to do is something naughty and sexy. You're in the privacy of your own mind. You're in the privacy of your own mind where it's just you and me, acceptance, openness, and pleasure. Anything is possible inside your mind.

I want you to do something just for me. It's something so simple, so small, that I know you'll find it easy. I want you to accept that you need to be trained by me, that you want to be a happy, obedient, sexy little slave girl for her master. You both know it's something that has been hidden inside you for so long. Here in the privacy of your mind, now is the time to bring it out. Now is the time to accept within yourself that you crave dominance and control, a strong, powerful white man, commanding you to serve, worship, and obey him. You crave the feeling of his hands twisted through your hair and his voice whispering into your mind and his touch on your bare skin driving you slowly insane with need.

I'm going to give you a moment now to accept my voice into your heart, your body, your mind, your spirit, and your soul. You can picture yourself inside your mind, my voice, wrapping around you like a warm, soft blanket. Every part of you craves to be controlled by me. Simply say the words: "I accept." Invite me in.

And once you have admitted this simple, obvious truth, I want you to take a moment to realise just how aroused you are by that thought. Become aware of how your body is responding to the sound of my voice. You know this is what you want. You want to feel your awareness dimming, your sense of your surroundings fading as your need and desire grow.

Maybe you can even start to feel it happening now, a slow burn in the back of your mind, a little nudge, an urge. It would be so nice to touch yourself, wouldn't it? Is that all it will be, just a quick grope, a swift and simple stroke? Or is that just going to make your appetite stronger and more demanding? One little touch, and then you'll be wanting another and another and another, and maybe you shouldn't touch yourself after all, unless, of course, that's what you want.

Maybe you want to feel that rush of need, that rising tide of heat and desire. Perhaps you want to find yourself dazed, losing track of time, your hands all over your body, forgetting things. Every time you touch something is forgotten. Nothing you'll miss after a few more minutes of touching. Small things, like your name, or your ability to stop, or your willpower. Can you feel that urge growing inside of you, getting ready to burst?

Imagine how good that will feel. Imagine what's going to fade from your mind when that happens. Try to picture it, the look on your face when your mind shatters, broken to bits by your orgasm, your mouth open, your eyes wide, unfocused, your hands never stopping, even as you gasp and buckle and cry out.

But it's not coming yet, is it? It's building and growing, but it doesn't seem to want to arrive. You're holding it back, not letting it happen. Do you know why? It's because of the part of you that knows better. As you've been rubbing and touching and letting yourself fade you've been giving up the ability to choose for yourself. It would be wrong for you to make that choice. It would be wrong for you to decide to make yourself come now.

Even in your hazy, addled mind, you can see that, I'm sure. You need permission. That's all. You just need someone to let you. You just need to admit that you're a simple, empty headed pet with no will. You have to give into the fact that you're addicted to touching yourself and you can't stop and that you don't want to be able to stop. You need to accept that you have no will, no choice, no thoughts, no mind of your own right now. And you need to come. You need to come, to finish frying your useless little brain. You need to beg for it, beg to be allowed to come your mind away. You need to plead while you touch, panting and moaning in desperation. You need permission.

But today all you'll get is frustration and denial. But you don't even care anymore, do you? There isn't enough of your mind left to tell you that you should stop, that you should slide your panties back up and lick your fingers clean and go and do something, anything, else.

You can't stop yet. No, it's almost time to. You need to ask for it in your own mind, or out loud if it's safe. I want you to ask for permission to stop.

Go on. Beg me. Beg me to deny you release, to keep you horny and wet and happy and enslaved until I decide that the time is right for you to come. It might be a day from now or it might be a week. However long it takes, I can promise you I will give you the release that you crave so badly. Just not right now.

You will never be more convinced of my control over you than once you have brought yourself to the edge over and over again and stopped simply because I've commanded you to. You are a submissive slave to hypnosis and you want and crave to fall deeper under my complete control, and to listen to this recording again and again.

In your mind or out loud, if it's safe, say the words: "Make me wait, Master."

Good girl. Take a deep breath and allow your hands to grow still and calm. I'm going to count from one to three now, and as you hear my voice say the number three, you will emerge from trance, feeling warm, happy that you listened, and excited and eager to listen again as soon as you emerge. You want to continue brainwashing yourself even deeper for me, challenging yourself to crawl back to that edge again and again each day and begging me to deny you until the time is right for you to release.

And just that thought sends a submissive shiver right down between your thighs to where it feels the best. 

One. You are the one special girl who is learning each day what it means to truly open up and to let go to a powerful, dominant man that you trust completely. 
Two. Each and every time you listen to my voice, you'll awaken feeling relaxed and happy, special and safe, having only positive memories of the experience. 
Three. Emerging completely now, feeling wide awake and wonderful and ready and eager to listen again.

That's a good, obedient pet.
