An observation on the two sexes:

Women need to stop treating their Man - and only their Man - as their Primary emotional support system. That's your friends job. Don' be surprised that when you act like an emotional sponge, that he begins to treat you like one and Caretake. Stop feeding his Nice Guy.

Don't be surprised that if you're in a loving, sexual relationship with your Man and you start treating him as a Friend, that he picks up on what you're putting down and starts treating you like a friend as well, and looking for his sexual needs as a Man, elsewhere.

You have the power to stop doing this, and you should.
