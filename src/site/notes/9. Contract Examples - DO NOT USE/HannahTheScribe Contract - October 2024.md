IMPORTANT NOTE: Always consider the context of any contract. This one is the end result of weeks of careful negotiation and a prexisting relationship.

It is listed here ONLY as a resource and for inspiration and ideas to add to your own agreements. A Contract or any agreement should be carefully negotiated, implemented slowly over time and generally I do not advocate long contracts as they are the BDSM version 1 model.

Instead I advocate for the BDSM version 2 Model which is outlined in the episode "BDSM Contracts 2.0" in the Mind Kink podcast at https://thewordsmithspeaks.com. 

You can always contact me, free of charge, if you have any questions.

AGAIN - do not simply copy and paste a contract, take individual ideas you both like and implement them slowly and cautiously.

It is included here not as an strict example to copy but for inspiration and thoroughness in it's approach, as well as being well written.

HannahTheScribe is an exceptional educator and as of time of writing I endorse her content without reservation.

She is also an exceptional example of internalised slavery and I strongly encourage paying for her coaching if that is a service she offers.

# Our Contract

As vowed in the Blood Oath, this contract is an agreement to a Mistress/slave dynamic. Kate and Hannah are married, with Hannah as the homemaker; Hannah is Kate's owned and collared slave.

## Exclusivity

This contract applies to Kate and Hannah only.

Hannah agrees to be monogamous. This means no power exchange, romance, kinky play, cohabitating, or sexual activity with other people.

-   Bedtime ritual/nighttime leashing protocols are as follows: Hannah will generally be leashed for the night at 10:30PM. If Kate is asleep or out of the house when it's time for bedtime leashing, Hannah may leash herself. Hannah may remove the leash for a few minutes if needed, and will releash herself upon returning if she does, unless told otherwise. Hannah will generally be unleashed for the morning at 8:15 AM. If Kate is asleep when it's time for morning unleashing, Hannah will wake her; if Kate is out of the house at that time, Hannah may unleash herself. Leashing or unleashing by Kate will be done in Leashing Position. Hannah will sleep nude on the floor at the foot of the bed and must sleep with a stuffie.

## Without Vanilla Company Protocols

-   When in Kate's presence and not standing, Hannah will assume her General Kneeling Position next to Kate. She will ask Kate's permission before changing position on the floor. She will not sit on the furniture or ask Kate's permission to, unless directed by Kate. This does not apply to the bed. She will wait behind her chair in Waiting Position before meals.
-   Before leaving Kate's presence, Hannah will ask if there's anything else she can do to be of service. If yes, she will do so first. When there is nothing else, she will ask for permission to leave (proper format). If granted, she will curtsy before she leaves. 
-   When entering Kate's office, Hannah will wait quietly near the entrance until she is acknowledged. If Kate cannot see her from where she is, she may move into the room as needed and wait. She may knock if the door is closed. 
-   If Hannah enters a space Kate is in and does not make eye contact, it will be assumed that she is passing through, and she may waive the entering and exiting protocols.
-   Hannah will respond to orders with, "Yes, Mistress," unless it would be disruptive to the conversation. Response will be based on intention, not phrasing. 
-   Hannah will respond to permission or favor grants or denials with, "Thank you, Mistress," unless it would be disruptive to the conversation. Response will be based on intention, not phrasing. 
-   Hannah will respond to praise or critiques with, "Thank you, Mistress," unless it would be disruptive to the conversation. Response will be based on intention, not phrasing. 
-   Hannah will address Kate as Mistress whenever clearly appropriate.
-   When asking for a permission, Hannah will use "may" (not "can"), always say please, and address Kate as Mistress, unless it would be disruptive to the conversation.
-   Hannah will wait for Kate to initiate interactions/speak only when spoken to. She may then assume permission to speak for the duration of that interaction. If she needs to request permission to speak, she will use Speech Request Position.

## Positions and Hand Signals 

-   General Kneeling Position: kneeling where directed, knees apart, big toes crossed in back (right over left), hands folded at small of back (right over left, right thumb over left thumb) unless in use, back straight. Ideal transition to kneeling: place hands in position, lower slowly to both knees at once, keeping the back straight, without wobbling, then spread knees/shift to position. Ideal transition back to standing: close knees, kneel up, stand one leg at a time, keeping the back straight and hands in position, without wobbling. (Permission must be obtained before shifting out of this position on floor.) 
-   Leashing Position: General Kneeling Position, but with leash across both palms, hands resting on thighs (or offering), hair/head out of the way, collar o-ring in front. (Permission must be obtained before shifting out of this position on floor.) 
-   Corner Position: standing facing wall, legs together, arms boxed behind back, nose touching wall, back straight, silent and still unless prompted. 
-   Inspection Position: standing in front of Kate, legs spread, hands clasped behind head, head/eyes straight, back straight. 
-   Waiting Position: standing where directed, legs together, hands folded at small of back, right over left, right thumb over left thumb, back straight, head/eyes down. 
-   Presenting Object Position: "General Kneeling Position", but with object across both palms, hands resting on thighs (or offering), head/eyes down. Always used when offering maintenance/discipline wand. 
-   Curtsy: from neutral/standing, back straight, lower head and eyes, grip hem of shirt on both sides between thumb and index finger and pull it slightly out with pinkies extended (exceptions made if hands are full), place ball of right foot behind left heel, briefly bend at the knees, straighten, place feet back to neutral, release hem, raise head and eyes slightly.
-   Speech Request Hand Signal: wrists crossed in front against the waist (or where visible), fists closed. (Remain silent until/unless permission is obtained.) 
-   Bathroom Request Hand Signal: tap Kate's knee three times. 
-   Note: while not codified, Kate uses variations of several hand signals such as Permission To Speak (opening fist with palm up) and Sit/Kneel (pointing at spot with index finger and moving finger down). These may be treated the same as a verbal signal within reasonable interpretation.

## Uniform

For Hannah's daily Uniform, she will wear her assigned black and purple plaid top, black boot socks, black leggings, black compression top, black underwear, collar, smart watch, and wedding ring. Watch and wedding ring may be removed and set nearby for tasks such as doing dishes. Shoes, if worn, will be the assigned black boots. She may choose her own jackets and bags, and use bathrobes, sunglasses, aprons, masks, bandages, headphones, and gloves as reasonable, unless told otherwise. She will wear the assigned purple hair bow in the back and remove it as practical.

Hannah will sleep nude unless given permission otherwise, except for her collar/leash and wedding ring. After Evening Inspection, she may wear her assigned white nightgown.

Her clothes should generally look neat, be in good repair, and fit well. She will shower at least every other day and shave any body hair at least once a week unless given permission otherwise, keep her bangs at a reasonable length, and keep her nails short. Kate will inspect Hannah's job of shaving immediately after each time she does so, in Inspection Position. Her hair will be left down.

Hannah may add, remove, or change out Uniform clothing items without prior permission if it is necessary to maintain a vanilla facade.  She will notify Kate of it as soon as reasonable. Any other visible changes must be approved.

## Daily Inspections

Each day after brunch cleanup is complete, Kate will ensure that Hannah's morning services were adequately completed, and let her know the results either way, handling punishment if necessary. She will inspect Hannah and her uniform in Inspection Position (Hannah should be waiting in position in the bedroom and inform Kate when she is ready).

Each day at 9 PM, Kate will ensure that Hannah's evening services were adequately completed, and let her know the results either way, handling punishment if necessary. She will inspect Hannah nude in Inspection Position. (Hannah should be waiting in position, undressed, in the bedroom at 9. She may remind Kate if needed.)

## Punishment

Hannah is subject to being punished by Kate, for violation of any of the terms of this contract and at Kate's discretion. Hannah is expected to self report as soon as possible. When Kate decides that Hannah should be punished, she will make sure to do so at the earliest opportunity, and communicate clearly that is what is happening and why, and discuss how the problem can be fixed and prevented.

## Light Slave Duty

Light Slave Duty is the term used to describe a period of time when Hannah will have reduced duties due to illness, etc. Hannah may request Light Slave Duty, or request to be off of Light Slave Duty. Kate will decide when Light Slave Duty is in effect, and communicate this to Hannah.

While in effect, "Inspections" and "Schedule and Routine" items may be skipped. In the case of travel, leashing may be skipped and provided sleeping arrangements may be used.

## Facing Issues

Both agree to raise issues verbally for small issues, and in writing for more involved issues.  The written report will include what happened to trigger the report, how it made the person feel, why they felt that way, what can be done to make it better right now, and what needs to be true for this to not happen again.  The issue will be raised as soon as possible within reason.

## Understanding

As vowed in the Blood Oath, the dynamic follows a total irrevocable consent model of M/s, and Hannah will not invoke safewords, limits, rights, relationship termination, or any other form of refusal.  This contract is a tool to communicate the current understandings and cannot be "enforced" from Hannah's side.  Kate may verbally make exceptions to, add to, remove, or change its contents between published versions, and will endeavor to maintain the overall integrity of the agreement as a matter of honor rather than due to enforceability.  If Kate chooses to dissolve the dynamic, she agrees to do so in a reasonable manner after due communication, and be open to ongoing discussion on further agreements.
