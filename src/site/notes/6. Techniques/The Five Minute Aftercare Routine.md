Summary: After sex or a scene, hold each other close for five minutes without speaking, simply connecting and being one with each other. After five minutes, you can speak gently and kindly if you wish, or lie there longer in silence.

After five minutes, tell the other person that you are proud of them, ask them if they are okay, keep touching them for as long as you want to and give them comfort and kindness, or whatever kind of aftercare and support was agreed upon beforehand.
