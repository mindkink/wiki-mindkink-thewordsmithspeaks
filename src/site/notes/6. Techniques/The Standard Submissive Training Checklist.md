The Intention is happy, healthy, sustainable relationships and long-term connection.

My preference is to train 5 - 6 girls in some way then the select the best ones for relationships, dating and fun. There are different timelines for "Girls you Train" and "Girls you are in a Relationship with and train". Also, if you think all of your problems will be fixed by having a partner, you are wrong. Women only amplify what is already in your life, both the good and the bad.

**Note:** Fix all your own major problems before taking on any kind of a relationship. Remove any Nice Guy behaviors, any Dependency Issues (become Independent) and have a high sense of Deservedness.

## Filter

Discard any girls who are not fully committed and motivated by the Objectives you develop together. Cleanly and finally discard any girls who are unreliable, dishonest, or who do not meet your standards (provided your standards are reasonable). Spend at MINIMUM four months of normal dating before deciding on a D/s relationship.

## Assess

Find out what needs to be cleared away to really allow her to flower and grow. Fear, guilt, shame, trauma. Assist and encourage her with empowering Core Beliefs and Boundaries. Assign core submissive reading material.

## Design

Teach her that if she cannot say no, then she cannot say yes. Teach and practice her saying no. Explain it is always her choice to move forward. Complete a Contract 2. 0. Complete a 3 Columns Chart and create a written Vision. Harmonise Definitions and Meanings. Use Hypnosis to create this vision as an experienced reality for her, then record and loop her through until it becomes inevitable. Remember the most important aspect of the relationship is FUN.

## Communicate

Setup a free Protonmail account for her and Threema / Signal for voice chat and messages export. Create a subfolder for her specifically in Filen and share useful material with her, so she always has access to it.

## Train

Use Operant Conditioning where appropriate, and Hypnosis where appropriate. Always train so that the girls are responsive to both you and to "anyone they choose". Take specific steps to avoid them growing attached and forming dependencies. Emphasize their choice in all of this and that "they are doing all the work so they deserve all of the reward". Begin with Intention and a healthy Frame, Create the Vision, work backwards from that to create a Plan, then implement and course correct. Incentive structures must be aligned and harmonious, communication clear and effective - follow the Rule for Shaping.

## Release / Enjoy the Fruits

Continue dating her casually, seeing her once a week / twice a month in person for fun. Follow Caleb Jones rules for communications to keep her expectations managed. Train five or six, then pick the best one/s to spend time with and continue to prioritise your own needs and your own life - avoiding the traps and pitfalls in an unhealthy relationship. Date for a MINIMUM of 4 months before investing your emotions in a girl at all. Find the one who is most compatible with your long term
vision for your life and build a family, a future together.
